  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive analysis of <span class='snippet'>tunable</span> transconductor topologies based on passive resistors is presented. Based on this analysis, a new <span class='snippet'>CMOS</span> transconductor is designed, which features high linearity, simplicity, and robustness against geometric and parametric mismatches. A novel tuning technique using just a MOS transistor in the triode region allows the adjustment of the transconductance in a wide range without affecting the voltage-to-current conversion core. Measurement results of the transconductor fabricated in a 0.5- mum <span class='snippet'>CMOS</span> technology confirm the high linearity predicted. As an application, a third-order <i>Gm-C</i> <span class='snippet'>tunable</span> low-pass filter fabricated in the same technology is presented. The measured third-order intermodulation distortion of the filter for a single 5-V supply and a 2-V<sub>pp</sub> two-tone input signal centered at 10 MHz is -78 dB.},

Potentially, this lattice can be used for an extremely low latency and high throughput <span class='snippet'>analog</span> signal processing device. The lattice can be fabricated on-chip with frequency of operation of more than 10 GHz.},

Energy harvesting mechanisms must hence be taken into account to grant a long time operational life, with solar energy being the most interesting one in outdoor deployments due to its relatively high power density. In this paper we propose a <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">low-power</emphasis> maximum power point tracker (MPPT) circuit <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">specifically</emphasis> designed for wireless sensor nodes (hence effective, flexible, low cost and power-aware), i.e., a power transferring circuit for optimally conveying solar energy into rechargeable batteries even in not optimal weather conditions. High efficiency is granted by an ad hoc adaptive algorithm which, by keeping the MPPT electronics in its optimal working point, maximizes energy transfer from the solar cell to the batteries. The suggested implementation is particularly effective in critical weather conditions where traditional solutions do not work and is characterized by a flexible enough design for immediately hosting, in a plug in fashion, different solar panels and battery typologies. </para>},

  Abstract                 = {<para> Despite their use in analog or mixed-signal applications, the high power overheads of traditional linear regulators (both series and shunt) have precluded their successful adoption in regulating the supply of energy-efficient digital circuits. In this paper, we show that linear regulation can in fact reduce the effective supply impedance of digital circuits without increasing their total power dissipation. Achieving this goal requires minimizing the static power dissipation of the regulator, leading to a push-pull topology (similar to the regulators demonstrated by Wu and Sanders, 2001, Poon <etal/>, 1999, and Intersil, 1998) with comparator-based feedback and a switched source-follower output stage. Measured results from a regulator implemented in a 65 nm SOI test-chip verify that by using these techniques, regulation reduces the effective supply noise by <formula formulatype="inline"><tex>$sim , $</tex></formula>30% while also enabling a slight decrease (1.4%) in total power dissipation. </para>},

  Abstract                 = {To analyze the potential of ground sensors for co-operative verification, the Bochum Verification Project has measured sound and soil vibration produced by military vehicles. Both signals contain contributions from the engine which usually dominate in the acoustic channel. With tracked vehicles, the track produces additional components which dominate the seismic signal at close to medium range and render it more than ten-fold stronger than that of wheeled vehicles. The acoustic amplitude decreases roughly with the inverse distance, while keeping the signal shape. The seismic amplitude decreases faster, but shows local variations; the seismic signal shape varies strongly with position. Acoustic and seismic spectra consist mostly of harmonic line series, caused by the engine and, if present, the track. Acoustic and seismic sensors can detect heavy vehicles passively, independent of weather and daylight, at more than 100m range. More complex tasks, such as vehicle-type recognition or trajectory determination, require further research.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic and seismic signals of military vehicles passing between two newly- developed sensor stations separated by about 100 m distance have been measured. Five tracked and five wheeled vehicles drove with seven speeds in both directions on four lanes. Rms values rose above background at distances of several 100 m for tanks, 60–80 m for a medium truck, and 40–50 m for a light van. By processing the acoustic and seismic maxima together, tracked and wheeled vehicles were separated correctly in 94% of the passes. An algorithm for detecting lines and harmonic series in acoustic spectra worked for eight vehicles. For vehicle-type recognition, learning-vector quantisation was used, working on the relative powers of the first 15 harmonics. This was successful in 95–98% of the tracked-vehicle passes and 69–95% of the wheeled-vehicle passes. These experiences and results suggest that sensor monitoring of control lines is feasible.},

The new rectifier saves silicon area by eliminating the need for additional large switches and provides more flexibility in choosing the most appropriate load shift keying mechanism by having the capability of both shorting and opening the transponder coil. This would result in a more robust back telemetry link with improved reading range and higher data rate. A prototype version of the rectifier was implemented in AMI 0.5-mum standard CMOS process, occupying -0.25 mm<sup>2</sup>. The back telemetry rectifier was powered through an inductive link and proved to be fully functional in its three modes of operation: rectification, open coil (OC), and short coil (SC).},

The fluorescent marker is a hematoporphyrin compound laser-excited with green light and imaged in the red fluorescence emission with a standard monochrome charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The gamma-ray (99mTc) pinhole imaging system uses a semiconductor pixel detector obtained by hybridizing a Silicon (300- mu;m thick) or a CdTe (1-mm thick) pixel detector to the Medipix2 (55- mu;m pitch) readout integrated circuit for single photon counting. The acquisition of combined images of the tumor area (fluorescence: animal top view; radionuclide: bottom view) shows that the tumor area can be imaged in a few minutes, with a few millimeter resolution (1-mm pinhole diameter), radioactively (99mTc MIBI, 74 MBq), and with the optical system. Combined imaging revealed also a different uptake of the two types of tumors studied (one grown from anaplastic human thyroid carcinoma-derived cells, the other from human papillary carcinoma-derived cells). Future progress will be toward a more compact optical setup and the use of a thicker CdTe detector.},

Standard harvesting circuits using piezoelectric elements as an electric generator consist of an AC-DC converter coupled to a load. The technique proposed herein is fully compatible with the standard approach. The difference consists in adding up an electrical switching device connected in parallel with the piezoelectric elements. The switch device is triggered on the maxima or minima of the displacement and realizes a voltage inversion through an inductor. This method allows the artificial increase of the piezoelements’ output voltage, resulting in a significant increase of the electrical power flow. It is shown that the power flow transfer strongly depends on the structure electromechanical coupling coefficient. For a weakly coupled structure using this new technique, the electrical power can be increased by over 400%.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a voltage regulator system for ultra-low-power RFID tags (also called passive tags) in a 0.15 mum analog CMOS technology. These tags derive their power supply from the incoming RF energy through rectification instead of from a battery. The regulator is functional with just 110 nA current. Owing to the huge variation of the rectified voltage (by as much as tens of volts), voltage limiters and clamps are employed at various points along the regulation path. A limiter at the rectifier output clamps the rectifier voltage to a narrower range of 1.4 V. A fine-regulator, then, regulates the supply voltage close to a bandgap reference value of 1.25 V. The key aspect of this regulator is the dynamic bandwidth boosting that takes place in the regulator by sensing the excess current that is bypassed in the limter (during periods of excess energy) and increasing its bias current and hence bandwidth, accordingly. A higher bandwidth is necessary for quick recovery from line transients due to the burst nature of RF transmission, with a larger energy burst requiring a higher bandwidth to settle quickly without large line transients. The challenge of compensating such a regulator across various load currents and RF energy levels is described in this paper},

  Abstract                 = {A prototype pixel detector readout chip has been developed with a new front-end architecture aimed at eliminating the spectral distortion produced by charge diffusion in highly segmented semiconductor detectors. In the new architecture neighbouring pixels communicate with one another. At the corner of each pixel summing circuits add the total charge deposited in each sub-group of 4 pixels. Arbitration logic assigns a hit to the summing circuit with the highest charge. In the case where incoming X-ray photons produce fluorescence-a particular issue in high-Z materials-the charge deposited by those fluorescent photons will be included in the charge sum provided that the deposition takes place within the volume of the pixels neighbouring the initial impact point. The chip is configurable such that either the dimensions of each detector pixel match those of one readout pixel or detector pixels are 4 times greater in area than the readout pixels. In the latter case event-by-event summing is still possible between the larger pixels. As well as this innovative analog front-end circuit, each pixel contains comparators, logic circuits and two 15-bit counters. When the larger detector pixels are used these counters can be configured to permit multiple thresholds in a pixel providing spectroscopic information. The prototype chip has been designed and manufactured in an 8-metal 0.13 mum CMOS technology. First measurements show an electronic pixel noise of ~ 72 e-rms (Single Pixel Mode) and ~ 140 e-rms (Charge Summing Mode).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the state-of-the art in vibration energy harvesting for wireless, self-powered microsystems. Vibration-powered generators are typically, although not exclusively, inertial spring and mass systems. The characteristic equations for inertial-based generators are presented, along with the specific damping equations that relate to the three main transduction mechanisms employed to extract energy from the system. These transduction mechanisms are: piezoelectric, electromagnetic and electrostatic. Piezoelectric generators employ active materials that generate a charge when mechanically stressed. A comprehensive review of existing piezoelectric generators is presented, including impact coupled, resonant and human-based devices. Electromagnetic generators employ electromagnetic induction arising from the relative motion between a magnetic flux gradient and a conductor. Electromagnetic generators presented in the literature are reviewed including large scale discrete devices and wafer-scale integrated versions. Electrostatic generators utilize the relative movement between electrically isolated charged capacitor plates to generate energy. The work done against the electrostatic force between the plates provides the harvested energy. Electrostatic-based generators are reviewed under the classifications of in-plane overlap varying, in-plane gap closing and out-of-plane gap closing; the Coulomb force parametric generator and electret-based generators are also covered. The coupling factor of each transduction mechanism is discussed and all the devices presented in the literature are summarized in tables classified by transduction type; conclusions are drawn as to the suitability of the various techniques.},

This device represents a big step forward both in terms of size and performance, and is in fact the last version of three generations of custom ASICs of increasing complexity. The top metal layer of the CMOS pixel array is patterned in a matrix of 105,600 hexagonal pixels with a 50&#xa0;Î¼m pitch. Each pixel is directly connected to the underlying full electronics chain which has been realized in the remaining five metal and single poly-silicon layers of a 0.18&#xa0;Î¼m VLSI technology. The chip, which has customizable self-triggering capabilities, also includes a signal pre-processing function for the automatic localization of the event coordinates. Thanks to these advances it is possible to significantly reduce the read-out time and the data volume by limiting the signal output only to those pixels belonging to the region of interest. In addition to the reduced read-out time and data volume, the very small pixel area and the use of a deep sub-micron CMOS technology has allowed bringing the noise down to 50 electrons ENC. Results from in depth tests of this device when coupled to a fine pitch (50&#xa0;Î¼m on a triangular pattern) Gas Electron Multiplier are presented. It was found that matching the read-out and gas amplification pitch allows getting optimal results. The experimental detector response to polarized and unpolarized X-ray radiation when working with two gas mixtures and two different photon energies is shown and the application of this detector for Astronomical X-ray Polarimetry is discussed. Results from a full Monte-Carlo simulation for several galactic and extragalactic astronomical sources are also reported.},

  Abstract                 = {In most of the applications contemplated for Walsh functions these binary waveforms would replace the more usual sinusoids, as the fast-Walsh-transform algorithm appears to make them very attractive for many kinds of signal processing. This paper begins with a brief review of the characteristics of Walsh functions and of their applications. Some old and some new interrelations are presented between sinusoids and Walsh functions, but the principal aim of the paper is to investigate the truncation and roundoff errors associated with the use of Fourier and of Walsh series. By employing simplifying approximations it is found that, for long samples of smooth signals, far more terms are required in the Walsh-series representation and greater accuracy is required of their coefficients for a given rms total error. Even for discontinuous signals the Walsh series may require substantially more terms, thus counterbalancing the computational advantage of the fast Walsh transform. This relative inefficiency of the Walsh-series representation of long waveforms may explain why it has not proven particularly effective in applications.},

Capacity scales with integration density because an entire row is read and written in parallel. Row activity is encoded in a burst: The row address followed by a column address for each active cell. We predict the distribution of burst lengths when transmission is initiated by active cells and access is arbitered using a two-level queuing model. Agreement with the experiment is excellent for loads over 50% but not for lighter loads, where our assumption that service time is exponentially distributed breaks down. We also quantify the throughput-latency tradeoff. The price of an n-fold increase in throughput is an n per Ncol timing error in a cell's inter-event interval, where Ncol is the number of cells per row. Links implemented in 0.6, 0.4, and 0.25 mu;m are compared; the highest burst-rate achieved was 27.8 M events/s.},

  Abstract                 = {A single Photon Counting pixel detector readout Chip (PCC) has been derived from previous work in the CERN RD19 collaboration for particle physics tracking devices, recently developed for high energy physics experiments. The readout chip is a 64 times;64 matrix of identical 170 mu;m times;170 mu;m cells. It is to be bump-bonded to an equally segmented 1 cm matrix of semiconductor sensors, e.g., Si or GaAs. Each readout cell comprises a preamplifier, a discriminator and a 15-bit counter. The input noise is 170 e-rms. At the lowest nominal threshold of 1400 e- (5.1 keV in Si) the cells exhibit a threshold distribution with a spread before adjustment of 350 e-rms. Each cell has a 5-bit register which allows masking, test-enable and 3-bit individual threshold adjust. After adjustment the threshold spread is reduced to 80 e-rms. Absolute calibration of the electrically measured equivalent charge can be done once the readout chip is bump-bonded to a detector },

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a novel step-up DC-AC piezoelectric-based power supply for driving piezoelectric actuators. Piezoelectric actuators have been demonstrated to be very attractive in applications requiring fast response and high actuation force, such as active damping applications. These actuators are commonly installed in self-powered systems (cars, helicopters, aircrafts, satellites, etc.) with limitation in the battery performance, dimensions and maximum weight. Nevertheless, the required driving electrical AC voltage for these actuators is typically in the range of 100 V to 1000 V, quite far from the 9 to 24 V of common batteries. Thus, the use of heavy, large and EMI-noisy electromagnetic transformers becomes necessary which is a drawback for the compact size required. This paper introduces an alternative system for driving piezoelectric actuators using a novel design of piezoelectric transformer, the Transoner®. The proposed solution allows a reduction in size, weight and magnetic noise generation compared to the classical electromagnetic-based systems. The work represents a completely novel approach to the possibilities of piezoelectric transformers for powering high voltage piezoelectric actuators. The solution offers significant advantages in environments requiring high integration, low weight, and low electromagnetic interferences operated with batteries. A circuit configuration capable of converting a 24 V DC input voltage up to 600 V AC output voltage with frequency and magnitude control is implemented. Experimental results are presented for a standard multilayer piezoelectric actuator driven at 100 V within the range of 10 Hz to 500 Hz.},

  Abstract                 = {Supply voltage scaling is one of the easiest ways to reduce energy dissipation. Therefore, researchers have considered subthreshold logic as a promising option to achieve ultra low energy dissipation. However, circuit propagation delay is extremely sensitive to PVT variations under subthreshold operation. Hence, large delay margin is required for successful operation of conventional synchronous designs. Since leakage energy contributes to a substantial portion of total energy dissipation in subthreshold operation, the leakage energy dissipated for the required delay margin degrades energy efficiency significantly. In addition, even small intra-die variations result in large clock skew and hence, it is difficult to efficiently handle timing issues such as the setup and the hold time violations. In this work, we explore asynchronous design approach to address these challenges in subthreshold operation. We employ critical-path replica to generate completion signals of combinational logic blocks and use classical four-phase handshaking for communication between pipeline flip-flops. Since the proposed design approach uses only local clock buffers, it is easier to handle timing problems compared to synchronous designs. We compared iso-yield minimum energy dissipation of two design approaches (synchronous and asynchronous) in an inverter chain. Despite leakage overhead due to pad delay of critical-path delay line and ?return-to-zero? time of four-phase handshaking, the proposed asynchronous design shows 71% energy savings compared to its synchronous counterpart. To demonstrate subthreshold operation of the proposed design approach, we fabricated an 8-tap FIR filter in 90 nm CMOS. Measured oscilloscope plots of handshaking and output bus signals show that the design operates successfully below 300 mV. We also measured energy consumption of the FIR filter from 19 test chips-the average was 4.64 pJ and the standard deviation was 0.3526 pJ.},

To address the issue of low power, researchers have reported FPGAs incorporating a variety of design techniques to improve energy efficiency. However, to date no work has focused on the combination of reconfigurable circuits with ultra-low voltage subthreshold logic. Powered at a voltage that is less than the threshold of the transistor – far below conventional levels - subthreshold circuits provide significant energy savings. Although subthreshold operation results in performance degradation of several orders of magnitude, some applications in which energy efficiency is prioritized can tolerate the reduced performance. The marriage of subthreshold logic and FPGAs is inevitable and therefore deserves investigation. Given the importance of boosted internal voltages in FPGAs for improved performance in the switching fabric as well as programmability of non-volatile configuration memory, this report describes a comprehensive comparison of existing charge pumps in the context of subthreshold operation and proposes a novel charge pump optimized for ultra-low voltage operation.},

The receiver serves as an analog-to-information conversion system that works at sampling rates much lower than the Nyquist rate. A parallel-path structure that employs current mode sampling techniques is used. The receiver performance is quantified analytically. Useful and fundamental design guidelines that are unique to CS are provided based on the analytical tools. Simulations with a 90-nm CMOS process verify the theoretical derivations and the circuit implementations. Based on these results, it is shown that an instantaneous receiver signal bandwidth of 1.5 GHz and a signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio of 44 dB are achievable. The receiver power consumption is estimated to be 120.8 mW. A comparison with state-of-the-art high-speed analog-to-digital conversions reveals that the proposed approach improves the figure of merit by a factor of three if the signal exhibits a 4% sparsity.},

The nMOS-only 6T 2C 25 mum times 25 mum pixel provides both analog readout of pixel intensity and a digital flag indicating temporal change at variable thresholds. Computation is performed through a pixel-level capacitively coupled comparator which also functions as analog-to-digital converter. The chip, fabricated in a 0.5 mum 3M2P CMOS, process consumes 4.2 mW of power while operating at 30 fps. Change sensitivity is 2.1% at an illumination of 1.7 W/cm2. Gating of raster-scanned pixel output by change detection typically produces a 20-fold compression in the data stream, depending on image conditions and reconstruction quality set by the change detection threshold.},

This conflict is due to not recognizing the probability of wind direction and its associated magnitude. It is also shown that the real time capacity may reach 298 percent of the normal rating, while the minimum capacity is 72 percent of normal. Finally, it is found that the real time conductor temperature for fifty percent of the time is only 47 percent of the conductor temperature used to establish the normal rating, while the load is approximately 45 percent greater than the normal rating for fifty percent of the time.},

  Abstract                 = {For the first time, equations and computer programs are developed to show how the solar radiation received by an overhead transmission line is dependent on the conductor sag or slope. In the past, the overhead line has been assumed to lie in a horizontal plane with respect to the earth for the entire span length. Mathematical relationships for determining the sun's position in terms of solar azimuth and solar altitude, as a function of latitude, declination and hour angle are formulated and a polar plot is constructed to show the apparent path of the sun during the day for each month. Two different methods are presented to determine the angle of incidence between the sun's ray and the normal to any sloped cylindrical surface oriented at any azimuth angle. Plots are provided to indicate the variation in the angle of incidence and the direct component of solar radiation absorbed as a function of solar time for four general transmission line azimuths and five slopes at one latitude and declination. In addition, plots are drawn for the total solar radiation received by a conductor on a typical clear day as a function of both the span length and any sag or slope for both minimum and maximum diffuse radiation conditions for four general transmission line azimuths at one latitude and declination. It is shown that the conductor slope can have as much of an effect on the total radiation as does the solar adsorption constant.},

  Abstract                 = {Electroneurogram (ENG) recording from tripolar cuff electrodes is affected by interference signals, mostly generated by muscles nearby. Interference reduction may be achieved by suitably designed amplifiers such as the true-tripole and quasi-tripole systems. However, in practice their performance is severely degraded by cuff imbalance, resulting in very low output signal-to-interference ratios. Although some improvement may be offered by post filtering, this considerably increases complexity, size and power dissipation, rendering the approach unsuitable for the development of a high-performance ENG recording system which is fully implantable. This paper describes an integrated, fully implantable, adaptive ENG amplifier developed to automatically compensate for cuff imbalance, and thus significantly improve the quality of the recorded ENG. Measured results show that the adaptive ENG amplifier has a yield of 100%, a cuff imbalance correction range of more than ±40%, and an output signal-to-interference ratio of about 2/1 (6 dB) even for ±40% imbalance. The latter should be compared with an input signal-to-interference ratio of 1/500 (-54 dB). The circuit was fabricated in 0.8-μm BiCMOS technology, has a core area of 0.68 mm2, and dissipates 7.2 mW from ±2.5 V power supplies. The adaptive ENG amplifier advances the state-of-the-art in implantable tripolar nerve cuff electrode recording techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0 lt;ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 lt;ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a framework for exploiting dimension-reducing random projections in detection and classification problems. Our approach is based on the generalized likelihood ratio test; in the case of image classification, it exploits the fact that a set of images of a fixed scene under varying articulation parameters forms a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Exploiting recent results showing that random projections stably embed a smooth manifold in a lower-dimensional space, we develop the multiscale smashed filter as a compressive analog of the familiar matched filter classifier. In a practical target classification problem using a single-pixel camera that directly acquires compressive image projections, we achieve high classification rates using many fewer measurements than the dimensionality of the images.},

This anode is a modified strip and strip anode which determines both the amount of charge deposited on each half of the anode and the centroid position for each event. We present experimental measurements of microchannel plate charge cloud distributions for a variety of detector operating conditions. We find that, as a first #x2010;order approximation, one can assume the charge cloud to be azimuthally symmetric. Additionally, the charge cloud remains virtually unchanged from event to event and pore to pore. The general form of the radial distribution is best described by the sum of two exponential components whose scale and relative weights vary with detector operating conditions. The central component of the distribution is three to six times smaller than the outer, or #x2018; #x2018;wing #x2019; #x2019; component. Typically most of the charge is in the central component. We have determined the scale and relative weights of the two exponentials for a fixed microchannel plate/anode gap of 6.2 mm and a range of detector operating conditions. The most significant variable determining the charge cloud distribution is the voltage between the back of the microchannel plates and the anode. As this voltage is increased from 50 to 800 V, the scale length of the central component shrinks from 1.4 to 0.5 mm and the weight increases from 50% to 85%.},

  Abstract                 = {Selective harmonic cancellation has become of primary importance in a wide range of power electronics applications, for example, uninterrupted power systems, regenerative converters, and active power filters (APFs). In such applications, the primary objectives are an accurate cancellation of selected harmonics and a quick speed of response under transients. This paper provides a novel signal-processing algorithm for selective harmonic identification based on heterodyning, moving average finite-impulse response filters, and phase-locked loop (PLL). The algorithm is applied over the current of a nonlinear load in the feedforward-based control of an APF. The PLL tracks the phase and frequency of the fundamental component. Then, the fundamental phase is multiplied by the order of the selected harmonic, and two random unitary orthogonal "axis waves" are generated. These unitary waves, rotating at the harmonic frequency, are multiplied by the input load current, thereby "moving" the Fourier series coefficients of the selected harmonic to DC (heterodyning). Moving average FIR filters are used to filter the harmonics generated in the heterodyning process from the DC signal; moving average FIR filters are very suitable for most of the power quality applications, thanks to their "comb-type" frequency response and their quick transient response. Experimental results confirm good performance for steady-state harmonic cancellation and an optimal system response to load transients. The theory of the algorithm has been developed for single- and three-phase systems.},

We propose that a reasonable goodness criterion is the information rate through the system, per watt of power dissipated. Speech applications requiring filter banks with a wide frequency tuning range, from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and low power consumption make the transconductance-C integrator in subthreshold CMOS the preferable integrator structure. As an example, the dynamic range of a lowpass filter is computed and subsequently used to design a filter bank that models faithfully cochlear micro-mechanics. The power consumption of the entire filter bank is computed from analytical expressions and is estimated as 355 nW, at 68 kb/s overall information rate at the output of the system},

Finally a circuit implementing the full signal conditioning of a piezoelectric accelerometer for adaptive pacemakers is presented, as an application example of the proposed OTA. The circuit consumes only 500 nA, and it can discriminate signals of 15 μV, because of the low input referred offset <; 5 mV of the source-bulk linearized OTA.},

In contrast, this paper develops neural-network-based models for predicting bearing failures. An experimental setup is developed to perform accelerated bearing tests where vibration information is collected from a number of bearings that are run until failure. This information is then used to train neural network models on predicting bearing operating times. Vibration data from a set of validation bearings are then applied to these network models. Resulting predictions are then used to estimate the bearing failure time. These predictions are then compared with the actual lives of the validation bearings and errors are computed to evaluate the effectiveness of each model. For the best model, we find that 64% of predictions are within 10% of actual bearing life, while 92% of predictions are within 20% of the actual life.},

  Abstract                 = { In the fields of wireless bioelectronics implants and sensor network systems, amplitude shift keying (ASK) is one of the most commonly used schemes employed to modulate the baseband signal with reference to the intermediate or even the carrier frequency. In this study, a demodulator architecture capable of dealing with most of the previous limitations in an ASK-utilized medical implant, especially in want of being powered through wireless delivering, is proposed. It features the abilities of working on a very small modulation index and being provided without any R/C component(s) inside by means of a self-sampling scheme. The design has been implemented in an 18- $mu{hbox {m}}$ CMOS process. The demodulator circuit occupies a die size of merely 32.3$,times,$ 14.5$~{mu}hbox{ m}^{2}$ . Analytic results from both simulated gradation and fabricated chips show that the proposed circuit can operate at a carrier of 2 MHz and achieve a modulation rate of up to 50%. The results also demonstrate that the presented work can still perform a proper demodulation even with a modulation index beneath 5.5%. An average power of approximately 336 $~mu hbox{W}$ was confirmed in return for the remarkable advantages. All aspects regarding the design, including a review of the prior arts, system consideration, circuit description, and analyses from simulation phase to actual measurement, are presented in detail. },

  Abstract                 = {Using piezoelectric elements to harvest energy from ambient vibration has been of great interest recently. As the power harvested from the piezoelectric element is relatively low, energy storage devices are needed to accumulate the energy for intermittent use. In this study, the energy storage devices considered include rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The traditional electrolytic capacitors are not considered due to their low energy density. The charge/discharge efficiencies of the energy storage devices are of major concern. The equivalent circuit model of the energy storage devices is investigated. It is found that the leakage resistances of the energy storage devices are the dominant factor that influences the charge/discharge efficiency in the piezoelectric energy harvesting systems. A quick test method is proposed to experimentally study the charge/discharge efficiencies of the energy storage devices. The experimental results verify our findings. Adaptability, lifetime, and charging protection circuit of the energy storage devices are also discussed. It can be concluded that supercapacitors are suitable and more desirable than the rechargeable batteries to store the energy in the piezoelectric energy harvesting systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents an overview of experimental evidence and present understanding of nonlinear dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric relationships in piezoelectric ceramics. This topic has gained an increasing recognition in recent years due to the use of such materials under extreme operating conditions, for example in electromechanical actuators and high power acoustic transducers. Linear behaviour is generally confined to relatively low levels of applied electric field and stress, under which the dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric relationships are described well by the standard piezoelectric constitutive equations. Nonlinear relationships are observed above certain ‘threshold’ values of electric field strength and mechanical stress, giving rise to field and stress-dependent dielectric (l), elastic (s) and piezoelectric (d) coefficients. Eventually, strong hysteresis and saturation become evident above the coercive field/stress due to ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain switching. The thermodynamic method provides one approach to describing nonlinear behaviour in the ‘intermediate’ field region, prior to large scale domain switching, by extending the piezoelectric constitutive equations to include nonlinear terms. However, this method seems to fail in its prediction of the amplitude and phase of high frequency harmonic components in the field-induced polarisation and strain waveforms, which arise directly from the nonlinear dielectric and piezoelectric relationships. A better fit to experimental data is given by the empirical Rayleigh relations, which were first developed to describe nonlinear behaviour in soft magnetic materials. This approach also provides an indication of the origins of nonlinearity in piezoelectric ceramics, in terms of ferroelectric domain wall translation (at intermediate field/stress levels) and domain switching (at high field/stress levels). The analogy with magnetic behaviour is also reflected in the use of Preisach-type models, which have been successfully employed to describe the hysteretic path-dependent strain-field relationships in piezoelectric actuators. The relative merits and limitations of the different modelling methods are compared and possible areas of application are identified.},

  Abstract                 = {Technological constraints severely limit the rate at which analog-to digital converters can reliably sample signals. Recently, Tropp et al. proposed an architecture, termed the random demodulator (RD), that attempts to overcome this obstacle for sparse bandlimited signals. One integral component of the RD architecture is a white noise like, bipolar modulating waveform that changes polarity at a rate equal to the signal bandwidth. Since there is a hardware limitation to how fast analog waveforms can change polarity without undergoing shape distortion, this leads to the RD also having a constraint on the maximum allowable bandwidth. In this paper, an extension of the RD, termed the constrained random demodulator (CRD), is pro posed that bypasses this bottleneck by replacing the original modulating waveform with a run-length limited (RLL) modulating wave form that changes polarity at a slower rate than the signal bandwidth. One of the main contributions of the paper is establishing that the CRD, despite employing a modulating waveform with correlations, enjoys some theoretical guarantees for certain RLL waveforms. In addition, for a given sampling rate and rate of change in the modulating waveform polarity, numerical simulations confirm that the CRD, using an appropriate RLL waveform, can sample a signal with an even wider bandwidth without a significant loss in performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Microelectromechanical (MEMS) structures for dc voltage conversion on a silicon substrate are presented. The boost conversion replaces the normal inductor for energy storage in a magnetic field by energy storage in a mechanical system. The mechanical design of the MEMS voltage converter is presented with good agreement between analytical and finite-element modelling (FEM) methods. A discrete analytical model for the converter output voltage at each MEMS actuation cycle is developed and results are compared with electrical device simulation in the PSpice environment. The model takes account of parasitic components in the system implementation, in particular in the blocking diode/switch. Typical MEMS and diode capacitance values are investigated and the voltage gain in these conditions is found to be negligible. The use of a MEMS switch in the blocking diode role can minimize these problems at the cost of more expensive control circuitry and increased power consumption. A suitable application in an RF receiver with intermittent electrostatic actuation of an array of MEMS resonators requiring high transient voltages is described. The efficiency of operation is less than 1.4\% but total power consumption is around 1 mJ and this may be acceptable in this intermittent mode of operation.},

  Abstract                 = { A complete equivalent model and analysis of high-efficiency charge-pump gain-increase (PGI) circuits with resistive loads are proposed. Based on this simple analytical model, the characteristics of PGI circuits can be approximately predicted and several handy equations, which are useful for pencil-and-paper design, can also be found for planning the desired circuit to achieve good enough performance with an acceptable accuracy tolerance in the steady state. In addition, an optimized design method for PGI circuits with resistive loads is developed in terms of the total number of gain stages in the design and the ratio between pump capacitors. For 1.5 V supply voltage operation, reliability and accuracy are demonstrated by comparisons between SPICE simulations of the PGI circuit and the results from the equivalent model. The model also has been validated by means of measurements taken from a test chip and typically shows relative open-loop output voltage errors lower than 8%. Finally, although the derivation of the model was based on a PGI circuit, it is shown that the design strategy can also be applied to other charge pump designs that have no voltage drop between the inner stages and the output stage. },

Then, a diagnostic index based on the computation of the energy in the previously defined bandwidth is used to diagnose bearing faults. The proposed method was validated experimentally with vibration signals, with robust and reliable results. The same procedure can be extended to current signals.},

In this method, outputs of a phase shift oscillator (PSO) are weighted and summed to obtain multiple outputs with very low distortion and precise phase relationship. The method allows a programmable number of harmonic distortion components to be cancelled over a wide frequency range. This work derives the condition for the weights on the outputs of the PSO to be a real quantity, and demonstrates how this can be used to generate low distortion sine waves. With the proposed method, in an N-stage PSO, harmonics up to N-2th can be canceled. Simulation results using commercial operational amplifier spice models are presented to demonstrate low distortion sine wave generation over 2 kHz–180 kHz frequency range. The method has been experimentally verified using extremely low-cost, discrete components to produce 100 dB total harmonic distortion (THD) sine wave.},

Part I of the paper presents a review of stochastic processes and spectral estimation (with some new results) and a tutorial on simulating continuous noise processes with a known autospectral density or autocorrelation function. In defining these techniques for computer generating sequences, it also defines the necessary accuracy criteria. These methods are compared to some of the common techniques for noise generation and the problems, or advantages, of each are discussed. Finally, Part I presents results on simulating stochastic differential equations. A Runge-Kutta (RK) method is presented for numerically solving these equations. Part II of the paper discusses power law, or 1/fα, noises. Such noise processes occur frequently in nature and, in many cases, with nonintegral values for α. A review of 1/f noises in devices and systems is followed by a discussion of the most common continuous 1/f noise models. The paper then presents a new digital model for power law noises. This model allows for very accurate and efficient computer generation of 1/fα noises for any α. Many of the statistical properties of this model are discussed and compared to the previous continuous models. Lastly, a number of approximate techniques for generating power law noises are presented for rapid or real time simulation},

The thicker steel cap enhances the endurance of the ceramic to sustain higher ac loads along with stress amplification. This study reports the performance of the cymbal transducer under ac force of 70 N with a pre-stress load of 67 N at 100 Hz frequency. At this frequency and force level, 52 mW power was generated from a cymbal measured across a 400 kO resistor. The ceramic diameter was fixed at 29 mm and various thicknesses were experimented to optimize the performance. The results showed that the PZT ceramic of 1 mm thickness provided the highest power output with 0.4 mm endcap. In order to accommodate such high dynamic pressure the transducer and cap materials were modified and it was found that the higher piezoelectric voltage constant ceramic provided the higher output power. Electrical output power as a function of applied ac stress magnitude was also computed using FEM analysis and the results were found to be functionally coherent with experiment. This study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using piezoelectric transducers for harvesting energy from high magnitude vibration sources such as automobile.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials is not a new concept, but its small generation capability has not been attractive for mass energy generation. For this reason, little research has been done on the topic. Recently, increased interest in wearable computer concepts and remote electrical devices has provided motivation for more extensive study of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The theory behind cantilever-type piezoelectric elements is well known, but the transverse moving plate elements, which can be used in energy generation from pressure sources is not yet fully developed. The power generation in a pressure-loaded plate depends on several factors. Among them, the thickness of each layer is important, as is the electrode pattern used. In this article, two clamped circular plate structures, a fully electroded unimorph, and a so-called regrouped electrode unimorph, are modeled. These models are then used to calculate energy generation with varying thickness ratios. The results of this analysis are presented with an eye toward guidelines for design of useful energy harvesting structures.},

Since the proposed buffer has a possible slew rate higher than 10 V/μs for a load capacitance of 1 nF almost independently of static currents as low as 1 μA, this buffer amplifier is promising for column driver ICs of flat panel displays that require low static power consumption, high current driving capabilities, and small silicon areas.},

An operational amplifier having an offset as high as ±20 mV can be compensated to have a residual offset of as low as ±1 mV. The offset is achieved by trimming the currents in the active loads of the differential pair stage of the op-amp. The trimming currents are obtained by means of a series of binary weighted current sinks. The result of compensation can be observed digitally. and the trim data that is needed to switch on or off the current sinks can also be sent serially in digital format. In this paper, a chip has been designed which incorporates the afore-mentioned compensation technique, and the initial version of the chip without the digital interface logic has been fabricated using AMI 0.5 μm CMOS technology},

Distributed in-field sensor-based irrigation systemsoffer a potential solution to support site-specific irrigation management that allows producers to maximize their productivity while saving water. This paper describes details of the design and instrumentation of variable rate irrigation, a wireless sensor network, and software for real-time in-field sensing and control of a site-specific precision linear-move irrigation system. Field conditions were site-specifically monitored by six in-field sensor stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. An irrigation machine was converted to be electronically controlled by a programming logic controller that updates georeferenced location of sprinklers from a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and wirelessly communicates with a computer at the base station. Communication signals from the sensor network and irrigation controller to the base station were successfully interfaced using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication. Graphic user interface-based software developed in this paper offered stable remote access to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of the variable-rate irrigation controller.},

Models for the matching of MOS and bipolar devices from open literature show that matching improves with increasing device area. As a result, accuracy requirements impose a minimal device area and this paper explores the impact of this constraint on the performance of general analog circuits. It results in a fixed bandwidth-accuracy-power tradeoff which is set by technology constants. This tradeoff is independent of bias point for bipolar circuits whereas for MOS circuits some bias point optimizations are possible. The performance limitations imposed by matching are compared to the limits imposed by thermal noise. For MOS circuits the power constraints due to matching are several orders of magnitude higher than for thermal noise. For the bipolar case the constraints due to noise and matching are of comparable order of magnitude. The impact of technology scaling on the conclusions of this work are briefly explored.},

The first 2m nonzero terms in the Walsh expansion yield a wave that has 2m steps per quarter-cycle. A notable feature of this wave is the wide separation between its harmonic pairs. For example, eight nonzero Walsh terms yield a wave whose only nonzero harmonics are the 31st and 33rd, the 63rd and 65th, etc., harmonic magnitudes being inversely proportional to frequency. Waves of this type are readily synthesized using a synchronous Walsh array generator with true and complement outputs, a level converter system, and a summing circuit.},

Power is recovered from a 450-MHz incident signal with the help of a low-threshold, high-efficiency, voltage rectifier-multiplier circuit. This technique decreases the minimum incident RF power required, compared to state-of-the-art wirelessly-powered telemetry systems. The rectifier-multiplier can collect energy from a base station placed up to 18 m away. To further increase the range from the base, the device collects energy in a low power standby/charging mode. A mode selector circuit monitors the amount stored energy and decides if the system is transmitting data or is in the standby/charging mode. A bootstrapped reference generates a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage with an R-squared regression of 0.9995 to a linear fit. This reference is used as the temperature sensor of the system, controlling a low-power, integrated, voltage-controlled LC oscillator (VCO). The oscillation frequency of the VCO is modulated by ambient temperature changes. The modulated carrier is transmitted by a fully integrated power amplifier. A temperature sensitivity of 126 ppm//spl deg/C is achieved and the entire sensor consumes 1.1 mA while transmitting data.},

  Abstract                 = {Several microactuator technologies have been investigated for positioning individual elements in large-scale microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Electrostatic, magnetostatic, piezoelectric and thermal expansion represent the most common modes of microactuator operation. This research focuses on the design and comparative performance evaluation of asymmetrical electrothermal actuators. The motivation is to present a unified description of the behavior of the electrothermal actuator so that it can be adapted to a variety of microsensor and microactuator applications. The MEMS polysilicon surface micromachined electrothermal actuator uses resistive (Joule) heating to generate thermal expansion and movement. In the traditional asymmetrical electrothermal actuator design, the single-hot arm is narrower than the cold arm, and thus, the electrical resistance of the hot arm is greater. When an electrical current passes through the device (both the hot and cold arms), the hot arm is heated to a higher temperature than the cold arm. This temperature differential causes the hot arm to expand along its length, thus forcing the tip of the device to rotate about the flexure. Another variant of the asymmetrical design features a double-hot arm arrangement that eliminates the parasitic electrical resistance of the cold arm. Furthermore, the second hot arm improves electromechanical efficiency by providing a return current conductor that is also mechanically active. In this design, the rotating cold arm can have a narrower flexure compared to the flexure in the traditional single-hot arm device because it no longer needs to conduct an electrical current. The narrower flexure results in an improvement in mechanical efficiency. This research compares the tip deflection performance of the asymmetrical single- and double-hot arm electrothermal actuator designs. Deflection measurements of both actuator designs as a function of arm length and applied electrical power are presented. As a practical application of the electrothermal actuator, the recent realization of a MEMS microengine is described, and evidence of its bi-directional motion is presented. The electrothermal actuator and microengine designs were accomplished with the MEMSPro® CAD software program, and they were fabricated using the MEMSCAP Integrated Microsystems Multi-User Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Process® (MUMPs) foundry.},

The design procedure is based on the direct simulation of a doubly terminated LC ladder filter by capacitors and fully balanced, current-controlled transconductance amplifiers with extended linear range. The on-chip automatic tuning circuit uses a phase-locked loop implemented with an 8.5-MHz controlled oscillator that matches a specific two-integrator loop of the filter. The complete circuit features 70-dB dynamic range (THD<-50 dB) and consumes only 16 mW from +or-2.5-V supplies.<>},

The biquad implements the notch, bandpass and low-pass transfer functions. The only parameter adapted is the resonant frequency of the biquad, which is identical to the notch frequency and the bandpass center frequency. The update method is based on a least-means-square algorithm which adapts the notch frequency to minimize the power at the notch filter output. The actual update is modified to reduce the circuit complexity to one biquad and one correlator. When the filter is tracking a sinusoid, this update generates a ripple-free gradient that decreases tracking error. Applications include phase-frequency detectors, FM demodulators (linear and frequency shift keying), clock extractors, and frequency acquisition aids for phase-locked loops and Costas loops.

  Abstract                 = {The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for parameters of harmonics in Gaussian noise have been well studied. If the phase of the signal is defined in the middle of the time interval rather than at the beginning (as is more common), the information matrix is approximately diagonal, and the formulation and analysis of the MLEs and CRBs are simplified. More significantly, this simple modification decouples the estimation of phase and frequency and leads to efficient MLE gradient descent algorithms. In this report, these MLE procedures and CRB analysis are presented for the multiple and coupled harmonic case, as well as for colored noise. A new criterion on the required sample size is presented to give uniform bounds on the accuracy of diagonal information matrix approximation; uniform bounds are needed to ensure the effectiveness of the gradient descent methods. These methods are demonstrated on real data from battlefield acoustic sensors, where they can be used to help identify targets of interest, such as tanks or trucks.},

This self-adaptive principle is based on a particular synchronization between extraction of the electric charge produced by the piezoelectric element and the system vibrations, which maximizes the mechanical to electrical energy conversion. An analytical expression of the optimal power flow is derived from a simple electromechanical model. An electronic circuit designed to perform the synchronous charge extraction is proposed. Theoretical predictions confirmed by experimental results show that the new principle increases the harvested power by 400% as compared with a quasilinear impedance adaptation optimization method.},

One such application is the monitoring of indoor environments to facilitate more efficient use of energy for climate control. Such an application necessitates an infinite-life power source that will work in low-light conditions. This paper details the design, fabrication, and testing of a self-powered wireless temperature sensor node. The sensor node, mounted on a wooden staircase, uses a piezoelectric bimorph to generate electricity from vibrations in the staircase. This generator powers a thermistor and wireless radio to transmit temperature readings to a remote computer. Vibrations generated by continuous traffic on the staircase produced 30µW from the piezoelectric generator, sufficient to power the sensor and radio hardware.},

By using the Walsh domain waveform analytic technique, the harmonic amplitudes of the inverter output voltage can be expressed as functions of switching angles. Thus, the switching angles are optimized by solving linear algebraic equations instead of solving nonlinear transcendental equations. The local piecewise linear relations between the switching angles and the fundamental amplitude can be obtained under an appropriate initial condition. By searching all feasible initial conditions, the global solutions are obtained. The relations between switching angles and fundamental amplitude can be approximated by straight-line curve fitting. Thus, on-line control of fundamental amplitude and frequency is possible for the microcomputer-based implementation. The developed algorithm can be applied to both bipolar and unipolar switching schemes. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by computer simulations and DSP-based hardware implementation},

  Abstract                 = {The power MOSFET functioning as a synchronous rectifier is a preferred choice in switch-mode converter circuits, especially for those of high frequency, high power density and low output voltage. However, its scope of application is handicapped by the compulsory requirement of additional sensing and gating circuits which provide the precise turning on/off timing control. A smart power synchronous rectifier (SPSR) is a two-terminal diode-like power integrated circuit (PIC) which provides very low on-state voltage rectification without the need of adding external gating control. In this paper, the design and fabrication of a fully CMOS-process compatible SPSR device is presented for the first time. The device had been successfully fabricated and its laboratory measurements indicated that the fabricated prototype has achieved a low forward voltage of 0.18 V in comparison with that of 0.25 V for Schottky diode and 0.72 V for the body diode at the same current density of 150 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. Also, the device has a low specific input capacitance of 11.8 nF/cm<sup>2</sup> as measured, which makes it suitable for the high frequency operation of above 1 MHz. The proposed SPSR configuration is suitable for CMOS fabrication process and can be integrated with on-chip dc/dc power converter circuit on the silicon substrate},

  Abstract                 = {An alternative image decomposition method that exploits prediction via nearby pixels has been integrated on the CMOS image sensor focal plane. The proposed focal plane decomposition is compared to the 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition commonly used in state of the art compression schemes such as SPIHT and JPEG2000. The method achieves comparable compression performance with much lower computational complexity and allows image compression to be implemented directly on the sensor focal plane in a completely pixel parallel structure. A CMOS prototype chip has been fabricated and tested. The test results validate the pixel design and demonstrate that lossy prediction based focal plane image compression can be realized inside the sensor pixel array to achieve a high frame rate with much lower data readout volume. The features of the proposed decomposition scheme also benefit real-time, low rate and low power applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of converting a conventional video stream based on sequences of frames into the spike event-based representation known as the address-event-representation (AER). In this paper we concentrate on rate-coded AER. The problem is addressed as an algorithmic problem, in which different methods are proposed, implemented and tested through software algorithms. The proposed algorithms are comparatively evaluated according to different criteria. Emphasis is put on the potential of such algorithms for a) doing the frame-based to event-based representation in real time, and b) that the resulting event streams resemble as much as possible those generated naturally by rate-coded address-event VLSI chips, such as silicon AER retinae. It is found that simple and straightforward algorithms tend to have high potential for real time but produce event distributions that differ considerably from those obtained in AER VLSI chips. On the other hand, sophisticated algorithms that yield better event distributions are not efficient for real time operations. The methods based on linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR) pseudorandom number generation is a good compromise, which is feasible for real time and yield reasonably well distributed events in time. Our software experiments, on a 1.6-GHz Pentium IV, show that at 50% AER bus load the proposed algorithms require between 0.011 and 1.14 ms per 8 bit-pixel per frame. One of the proposed LFSR methods is implemented in real time hardware using a prototyping board that includes a VirtexE 300 FPGA. The demonstration hardware is capable of transforming frames of 64times64 pixels of 8-bit depth at a frame rate of 25 frames per second, producing spike events at a peak rate of 107events per second},

This way, subpicoampere currents are characterized without driving them off chip and requiring expensive instrumentation with complicated low leakage setups. A special <span class='snippet'>current</span> mirror is also introduced for reliably replicating such low currents. As an example, a simple log-domain first-order low-pass filter is implemented that uses a 100-fF capacitor and a 3.5-fA bias <span class='snippet'>current</span> to achieve a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz. A technique for characterizing noise at these currents is also described and verified. Finally, transistor mismatch measurements are provided and discussed.

A 20- mu;m wide octagonal opening connects the detector and the preamplifier input via bump bonding. The preamplifier feedback provides compensation for detector leakage current on a pixel by pixel basis. Two identical pulse height discriminators are used to create a pulse if the preamplifier output falls within a defined energy window. These digital pulses are then counted with a 13-b pseudorandom counter. The counter logic, based in a shift register, also behaves as the input-output register for the pixel. Each cell also has an 8-b configuration register which allows masking, test-enabling and 3-b individual threshold adjust for each discriminator. The chip can be configured in serial mode and readout either serially or in parallel. The chip is designed and manufactured in a 6-metal 0.25- mu;m CMOS technology.

  Abstract                 = {Two circuit techniques adopted in the design of an embedded programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) for very low-voltage (LV) wireless local-area network systems are presented. A switched-current-resistor (SCR) technique minimizes the bandwidth variation and the transient in gain tuning by stabilizing, concurrently, the PGA's feedback factor and quiescent-operating point. Another technique, inside-opamp dc-offset canceller (DOC), embeds inside the PGA's opamp a subthreshold-biased - integrator for extracting its output dc-offset, while negatively feeding the correction (current) signal back to the opamp at an inherent low-impedance node. The resultant main benefits are: 1) the chip area, for realizing the large time constant in dc-offset extraction, is very small and 2) the lower cutoff of the PGA and the DOC-induced nonlinearity and noise are all suppressed by an amount of the loop gain in closed-loop formation. A 1-V three-stage 52-dB gain range PGA reinforcing such two techniques was designed and fabricated in a 3.3-V 0.35- CMOS process. It consumes 7.4 mW of power while measuring gain-switching transient and IIP3. The means of the lower and upper cutoffs (averaged over 52-dB gain steps) are 2.25 kHz and 17.1 MHz, respectively.},

Arrays of cantilever test structures were fabricated in a commercial CMOS IC process and were released using XeF<sub>2</sub> as a postprocessing etch. A piezoelectric transducer placed under the test chip was used to excite the cantilevers to resonance, and the resonance frequency was measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer. It is reported that excellent agreement for values of Young's modulus is observed for cantilevers between 200 and 400 mum in length, with average standard deviation being 4.07 GPa.},

  Abstract                 = {Variable capacitors are key elements in electrostatic micro-power generators. In such devices inertial forces are used to do work against the electric field of the capacitor, thereby converting mechanical energy to electrical potential energy that can be extracted by a suitable circuit. Applications are envisaged in portable, wearable or implantable electronic devices where body motion could provide the mechanical energy source. This paper describes the fabrication and initial testing of a micro- machined variable capacitor for power generation, with overall dimensions in the meso-scale. The measured capacitance of the device varies from 100 pF to around 1pF as the mass moves from initial to final position, corresponding to a hundred-fold increase in voltage if the device is operated in constant charge mode. Initial tests of the capacitor on a vibration system (10Hz) have shown that a periodic high voltage output of 2.3 kV can be generated if the capacitor is charged by a voltage source of 26 V. This corresponds to an energy conversion rate of 2.4 µJ per cycle, or 24 µW at a vibration frequency of 10Hz.},

The large amount of pixels in combination with the possible thickness of the sensor layer enables dosimetry at very low dose rates. A method has been developed to determine personal dose equivalents from the number of counts in energy deposition intervals measured with a semiconductor photon counting pixel detector, despite the strong influence of charge sharing effects among pixels. We tested the method experimentally by reconstructing the air kerma free in air for different qualities of X-radiation in the energy range below 150 keV with an accuracy better than 4%. We show that the response of a dosimeter based on a hybrid photon counting pixel detector can fulfill the IEC type testing requirements. The statistical precision is high due to the thickness and the large area of the sensor layer. We estimate that a dosimeter based on the Medipix detector will be able to cope with dose rates of more than approximately 57 Sv/h for mathdot Hp (0.07) or 19 Sv/h for mathdot Hp(10) . We outline the advantages and perspectives of using this kind of detector in a dosimeter in comparison to standard active personal dosimeters.},

  Abstract                 = { The future of ground-based optical astronomy lies with advancements in adaptive optics (AO) to overcome the limitations that the atmosphere places on high resolution imaging. A key technology for AO systems on future very large telescopes are the wavefront sensors (WFS) which detect the optical phase error and send corrections to deformable mirrors. Telescopes with$ #8811;$30 m diameters will require WFS detectors that have large pixel formats (512$times$512), low noise$( #8810;3 e^-/hboxpixel)$and very high frame rates ($sim$1 kHz). These requirements have led to the idea of a bare CMOS active pixel device (the Medipix2 chip) functioning in counting mode as an anode with noiseless readout for a microchannel plate (MCP) detector and at 1 kHz continuous frame rate. First measurement results obtained with this novel detector are presented both for UV photons and beta particles.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors present a sub-Nyquist analog-to-digital converter of wideband inputs. The circuit realises the recently proposed modulated wideband converter, which is a flexible platform for sampling signals according to their actual bandwidth occupation. The theoretical work enables, for example, a sub-Nyquist wideband communication receiver, which has no prior information on the transmitter carrier positions. The present design supports input signals with 2 GHz Nyquist rate and 120 MHz spectrum occupancy, with arbitrary transmission frequencies. The sampling rate is as low as 280 MHz. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first reported hardware that performs sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction of wideband signals. The authors describe the various circuit design considerations, with an emphasis on the non-ordinary challenges the converter introduces: mixing a signal with a multiple set of sinusoids, rather than a single local oscillator, and generation of highly transient periodic waveforms, with transient intervals on the order of the Nyquist rate. Hardware experiments validate the design and demonstrate sub-Nyquist sampling and signal reconstruction.},

The main functions of this framework are two: Analog compression that narrows down the input bandwidth prior to sampling with commercial devices followed by a nonlinear algorithm that detects the input subspace prior to conventional signal processing. A representative union model of spectrally sparse signals serves as a test-case to study these Xampling functions. We adopt three metrics for the choice of analog compression: robustness to model mismatch, required hardware accuracy, and software complexities. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between two sub-Nyquist acquisition strategies for spectrally sparse signals, the random demodulator and the modulated wideband converter (MWC), in terms of these metrics and draw operative conclusions regarding the choice of analog compression. We then address lowrate signal processing and develop an algorithm for that purpose that enables convenient signal processing at sub-Nyquist rates from samples obtained by the MWC. We conclude by showing that a variety of other sampling approaches for different union classes fit nicely into our framework.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a wireless RF CMOS interface for soil moisture measurements. The interface basically comprises a Delta-Sigma ([Delta][Sigma]) modulator for acquiring an external sensor signal, and a RF section where data is transmitted to a local processing unit. The [Delta][Sigma] modulator is a single-bit, second-order modulator and it is implemented using switched-capacitors techniques in a fully-differential topology. With a sampling frequency of 423.75 kHz and an oversampling ratio (OSR) of 256, the modulator achieves a dynamic range of 98.7 dB (16.1 bit). The output of the modulator is applied to a counter, as a first-order decimation filter, and the result is stored. Prior to transmission, data is encoded as a pulse width modulated signal and assembled in a frame containing preamble and checksum control fields. This frame is then transmitted through a power amplifier operating at 433.92 MHz in class-E mode. To evaluate the [Delta][Sigma] modulator performance, the bitstream was acquired and transferred to a personal computer to perform digital filtering and decimation using MATLAB. The soil moisture sensor is based on dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method and is implemented by using an integrated temperature sensor and a heater. After applying a heat-pulse for a fixed period of time, the temperature rise, that is a function of soil moisture, generates a differential voltage that is amplified and applied to the mixed-signal interface input. The described interface can also be used with other kinds of environmental sensors in a wireless sensors network. The CMOS mixed-signal interface has been implemented in a single-chip using a standard CMOS 0.7 [mu]m process (AMI C07M-A, n-well, 2 metals and 1 poly).},

The information-carrying capability is assessed and the trade-off between accuracy of the transmitted information and attainable dynamic range is brought out in terms of simple global parameters that characterize the application. It is found that the proposed architecture is well suited for the kind of communication requirements associated to neural computation systems.

The resulting FeRAM-based tag has a nominally identical communication range for both read and write operations, which is indispensable for data write applications. The evaluated tag communication range with a folded dipole antenna is from 0 m to 4.3 m, at the 953-MHz carrier frequency with 4-W transmitting Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) from a reader/writer. The developed tag IC features two circuit blocks to maximize the communication range in 0.35-mum CMOS/FeRAM technology. First is a CMOS-only full-wave rectifier, which can improve the measured efficiency by up to 36.6% by reducing the input parasitic capacitances and optimization of multiplier structure. This efficiency is more than twice that of previously-published results. Second is a low-voltage current-mode ASK demodulator to accommodate a low-breakdown voltage of FeRAM, which converts the ASK power modulation into a linearly modulated current over an incoming power range of 27 dB, corresponding to the entire communication range. The developed demodulator can thus resolve the primary design tradeoff issue between device protection and detection sensitivity in the conventional voltage-mode demodulator},

The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other signals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place. In particular, such a review helps to avoid repetition of past work and gives a bird's eye view to a new researcher in this area.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensors play a crucial role in structural systems with concern over reliability/ failure issues. The development of wireless monitoring systems has been of great interest because wireless transmission has been proven as a convenient means to transmit signals while minimizing the use of many long wires. However, the wireless transmission systems need sufficient power to function properly. Conventionally, batteries are used as the power sources for the remote sensing systems. However, due to their limited lifetime, replacement of batteries has to be carried out periodically, which is inconvenient. In recent years, piezoelectric materials have been developed as sensing and actuating devices mostly, and power generators in some cases. In this article, a self-powered piezoelectric sensor is studied, in which one piece of piezoelectric element is simultaneously used as a sensor and a power generator under vibration environment. Concurrent design with piezoelectric materials in sensor and power generator is integrated with energy storage device. We evaluate sensing and power generating abilities individually and then energy harvesting performances. The potential of the piezoelectric sensor to power wireless transmission systems is discussed. Experimental efforts are carried out to study the feasibility of the self-powered piezoelectric sensor system.},

The sensor comprises an array of 128times128 single-photon pixels, a bank of 32 time-to-digital-converters, and a 7.68 Gbps readout system. Thanks to the outstanding timing precision of single-photon avalanche diodes and the optimized measurement circuitry, a typical resolution of 97 ps was achieved within a range of 100 ns. To the best of our knowledge, this imager is the first fully integrated system for photon time-of-arrival evaluation. Applications include 3-D imaging, optical rangefinding, fast fluorescence lifetime imaging, imaging of extremely fast phenomena, and, more generally, imaging based on time-correlated single photon counting. When operated as an optical rangefinder, this design has enabled us to reconstruct 3-D scenes with milimetric precisions in extremely low signal exposure. A laser source was used to illuminate the scene up to 3.75 m with an average power of 1 mW, a field-of-view of 5deg and under 150 lux of constant background light. Accurate distance measurements were repeatedly achieved based on a short integration time of 50 ms even when signal photon count rates as low as a few hundred photons per second were available.},

  Abstract                 = {This study analyzes the most fundamental constraint of RFID systems that is power rectification. This issue plays an important role in the development of long range RFID systems especially the passive RFID system. Rectifiers are the key components in power rectification and efficiency of any RFDD system. This paper concentrates in investigating this major issue. Therefore, to tackle the major problem that affects the efficiency of RFID system, this study proposed Schottky barrier diode model in standard CMOS fabrication process. The proposed SBD provides good power conversion rate and switching properties. In order to reduce the series resistance of Schottky contact, interdigitating fingers of Schottky diode layout has been adopted. The parameters of Schottky barrier diode such as saturation current, series resistance, junction capacitance, breakdown voltage and Schottky barrier height have also been optimized. Then the UHF rectifying circuit uses these SBDs to measure conversion efficiency of the SBD at RF frequency of 915 MHz.},

The primary benefit of this technique is that it estimates a spectral emphasis filter that can be used to manipulate the perceived vocal effort. The other benefit of APLP is that it estimates a formant filter that is more consistent across varying voice qualities. This paper describes how constant pre-emphasis linear prediction (LP) estimates a voice source with a constant spectral envelope even though the spectral envelope of the true voice source varies over time. A listening experiment demonstrates how differences in vocal effort and breathiness are audible in the formant filter estimated by constant pre-emphasis LP. APLP is presented as a technique to estimate a spectral emphasis filter that captures the combined influence of the glottal source and the vocal tract upon the spectral envelope of the voice. A final listening experiment demonstrates how APLP can be used to effectively transform high-effort voices into breathy voices. The techniques presented here are relevant to researchers in voice conversion, voice quality, singing, and emotion.},

A CMOS high dynamic range, high-drive buffer suitable for driving large capacitive loads is presented in this paper. An area-efficient output stage has been used, with which a rail-to-rail drive capability into a 5000 pF load at 160 kHz is achieved. The circuit occupies only 110 mils2 in a 3 μm technology. The output range is rail to rail for R>10 kΩ. The buffer is capable of driving resistive loads down to 300 Ω with acceptable THD},

  Abstract                 = {Silicon materials remain unused for supercapacitors due to extreme reactivity of silicon with electrolytes. However, doped silicon materials boast a low mass density, excellent conductivity, a controllably etched nanoporous structure, and combined earth abundance and technological presence appealing to diverse energy storage frameworks. Here, we demonstrate a universal route to transform porous silicon (P-Si) into stable electrodes for electrochemical devices through growth of an ultra-thin, conformal graphene coating on the P-Si surface. This graphene coating simultaneously passivates surface charge traps and provides an ideal electrode-electrolyte electrochemical interface. This leads to 10–40X improvement in energy density, and a 2X wider electrochemical window compared to identically-structured unpassivated P-Si. This work demonstrates a technique generalizable to mesoporous and nanoporous materials that decouples the engineering of electrode structure and electrochemical surface stability to engineer performance in electrochemical environments. Specifically, we demonstrate P-Si as a promising new platform for grid-scale and integrated electrochemical energy storage.},

We discuss the implementation of temperature sensor. The fully integrated complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) batteryless device measures temperature and performs calibration to compensate for the sensor's inherent imperfections. An RF link using passive RFID's backscattering technique wirelessly transmits the data to a reading device while extracting power from the same "airwave," letting the device operate anywhere and last almost forever. The entire microchip, including the temperature sensor, consumes less than a few microamperes over a half a second, so the scanning device can capture data from longer read distances.},

  Abstract                 = {Many in the mathematical community believe that the secant method arose from Newton’s method using a finite difference approximation to the derivative, most likely because that is the way that it is taught in contemporary texts. However, we were able to trace the origin of the secant method all the way back to the Rule of Double False Position described in the 18th-century b.c. Egyptian Rhind Papyrus, by showing that the Rule of Double False Position coincides with the secant method applied to a linear equation. As such, it predates Newton’s method by more than 3,000 years. In this paper, we recount the evolution of the Rule of Double False Position as it spanned many civilizations over the centuries leading to what we view today as the contemporary secant method. Unfortunately, throughout history naming confusion has surrounded the Rule of Double False Position. This naming confusion was primarily a product of the last 500 years or so and became particularly troublesome in the past 50 years, creating confusion in the use of the terms Double False Position method, Regula Falsi method, and secant method. We elaborate on this confusion and clarify the names used.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy harvesting has grown from long-established concepts into devices for powering ubiquitously deployed sensor networks and mobile electronics. Systems can scavenge power from human activity or derive limited energy from ambient heat, light, radio, or vibrations. Ongoing power management developments enable battery-powered electronics to live longer. Such advances include dynamic optimization of voltage and clock rate, hybrid analog-digital designs, and clever wake-up procedures that keep the electronics mostly inactive. Exploiting renewable energy resources in the device's environment, however, offers a power source limited by the device's physical survival rather than an adjunct energy store. Energy harvesting's true legacy dates to the water wheel and windmill, and credible approaches that scavenge energy from waste heat or vibration have been around for many decades. Nonetheless, the field has encountered renewed interest as low-power electronics, wireless standards, and miniaturization conspire to populate the world with sensor networks and mobile devices. This article presents a whirlwind survey through energy harvesting, spanning historic and current developments.},

  Abstract                 = {A new low voltage charge pump is developed to help start up a step-up converter in energy harvesting applications. The proposed charge pump is the first to utilize both backward control scheme and two branches of charge transfer switches (CTSs) to direct charge flow. The backward control scheme uses the internal boosted voltage to dynamically control the CTSs' gate, and the two branches utilize both NMOS and PMOS to implement their switching structure. The combination of backward control scheme and two-branch operation allows the CTSs to be completely turned on and off. Thus, the reverse charge sharing phenomenon and switching loss are significantly reduced, which effectively improves pumping efficiency. The last stage is specially designed to improve the charge pump's charge and capacitance drivability. Using subthreshold operation and body-bias technique, the charge pump and its clock generator can operate under a low voltage supply. The proposed charge pump circuit is designed in a standard 0.18 $mu$ m CMOS process. It consists of 6 stages, each with a 24 pF pumping capacitor (total 288 pF pumping capacitance area). Under a 320 mV supply, the measured output voltage of the proposed charge pump can rise from 0 to 2.04 V within 0.1 milliseconds.},

It is shown that the introduction of intermediate frames, coupling equivalent points of the lateral suspension either side of the suspended mass, can provide much improved dynamics. To investigate the derived relationships, suspensions have been fabricated using through-wafer deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). Using analysis of the suspension dynamics under the rastered beam of a scanning electron microscope, the various modes of the suspension have been visualized and quantiﬁed. These observations are in good agreement with the derived formulae, taking into account the actual proﬁle of the beams fabricated in DRIE. Further ﬁnite element analysis across a broad range of suspensions is consistent with the derived formulae.

  Abstract                 = {Piezoelectric materials have long been used as sensors and actuators, however their use as electrical generators is less established. A piezoelectric power generator has great potential for some remote applications such as in vivo sensors, embedded MEMS devices, and distributed networking. Such materials are capable of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, but developing piezoelectric generators is challenging because of their poor source characteristics (high voltage, low current, high impedance) and relatively low power output. In the past these challenges have limited the development and application of piezoelectric generators, but the recent advent of extremely low power electrical and mechanical devices (e.g., MEMS) make such generators attractive. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of piezoelectric power generation that is verified with simulation and experimental results. Several important considerations in designing such generators are explored, including parameter identification, load matching, form factors, efficiency, longevity, energy conversion and energy storage. Finally, an application of this analysis is presented where electrical energy is generated inside a prototype Total Knee Replacement (TKR) implant.},

  Abstract                 = {A broad range of high-volume consumer applications require low-power battery-operated wireless microsystems and sensors. These systems should conciliate a sufficient battery lifetime with reduced dimensions, low cost, and versatility. Their design highlights the tradeoff between performance, lifetime, cost, and power consumption. Also, special circuit and design techniques are needed to comply with the reduced supply voltage (down to 1 V, for single battery cell operation). These considerations are illustrated by the design of a prototype receiver chip realized in a standard 0.5-&mu;m digital CMOS process with 0.6-V threshold voltage. The chip is dedicated to a distributed sensors network and is based on a direct-conversion architecture. The circuit operates at 1-V power supply in the 434-MHz European ISM band and consumes only 1 mW in receive mode. It achieves a -95 dBm sensitivity for a data rate of 24 kb/s},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast reduction in the size and power consumption of sensors and CMOS circuitry has led to a focused research effort on the on-board power sources which can replace the batteries. The concern with batteries has been that they must always be charged before use. Similarly, the sensors and data acquisition components in distributed networks require centralized energy sources for their operation. In some applications such as sensors for structural health monitoring in remote locations, geographically inaccessible temperature or humidity sensors, the battery charging or replacement operations can be tedious and expensive. Logically, the emphasis in such cases has been on developing the on-site generators that can transform any available form of energy at the location into electrical energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesting has emerged as one of the prime methods for transforming mechanical energy into electric energy. This review article provides a comprehensive coverage of the recent developments in the area of piezoelectric energy harvesting using low profile transducers and provides the results for various energy harvesting prototype devices. A brief discussion is also presented on the selection of the piezoelectric materials for on and off resonance applications. Analytical models reported in literature to describe the efficiency and power magnitude of the energy harvesting process are analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {A new passive sensor for remote measurement of water content in sandy soil was designed, using a surface acoustic wave (SAW) reflective delay line. Information from this sensor can be obtained by an interrogation device via a radio link operating in the European 434-MHz industrial-scientific-medical band. The SAW device, manufactured on the YZ cut of LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, is mounted and sealed in a standard dual inline 16 package and contains four electroacoustic transducers. One transducer is connected to an external antenna to pick up an RF request signal from the interrogation device and to send back an RF response. The second transducer operates as a reflector. The bus bars of this transducer are connected with two measuring rods through an electrical transmission line. These rods can be inserted into sandy soil. The final two transducers operate as reflectors and are included for reference purposes. The transmission line and the two rods spanning the sand-water mixture have a characteristic impedance Z<sub>load</sub>, which loads the second transducer. Changes in the soil water content are observed as a change of the total permittivity due to the high permittivity of free water, which, in turn, affects Z<sub>load</sub>, as well. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic reflection at the second transducer changes due to a variation of the terminating Z<sub>load</sub>. This then results in a difference in attenuation and phase of the corresponding peak in the time domain. Thus, the RF response of the sensor carries information about the water content between the rods, which, therefore, can be detected by and evaluated in the interrogation unit},

  Abstract                 = {A two-dimensional (2-D) array (4 by 8) of single-photon avalanche diodes integrated in an industrial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process is presented. Each pixel combines a photodiode biased above its breakdown voltage in the so-called Geiger mode, a quenching resistor, and a simple comparator. The pitch between the pixels is 75 /spl mu/m and the diameter of each pixel is 6.4 /spl mu/m. The full integration allows reducing the number of charge carriers in a Geiger pulse. The electroluminescence responsible for optical crosstalks between pixels is then reduced leading to a negligible optical crosstalk probability. Thanks to the cleanness of the fabrication process, no afterpulsing effects are noticed. At room temperature, most of the pixels exhibit a dark-count rate of about 50 Hz. The detection probability is almost identical for all 32 pixels of the array with relative variation in the range of a few percents. This letter demonstrates the feasibility of an array of single-photon detectors sensitive in the visible part of the spectrum. Besides low production costs and compactness, an undeniable benefit lies in the potential to easily modify the design to fit a specific application. Furthermore, the CMOS integration opens the way to on-chip data processing.},

Most research is focused on a particular technology, and it is often difficult to compare widely differing designs and approaches to vibration-based energy harvesting. The aim of this study is to provide a general theory that can be used to compare different approaches and designs for vibration-based generators. Estimates of maximum theoretical power density based on a range of commonly occurring vibrations, measured by the author, are presented. Estimates range from 0.5 to 100mW/cm 3for vibrations in the range of 1–10 m/s 2at 50–350 Hz. The theory indicates that, in addition to the parameters of the input vibrations, power output depends on the system coupling coefficient, the quality factor of the device, the mass density of the generator, and the degree to which the electrical load maximizes power transmission. An expression for effectiveness that incorporates all of these factors is developed. The general theory is applied to electromagnetic, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and electrostatic transducer technologies. Finally, predictions from the general theory are compared to experimental results from two piezoelectric vibration generator designs.},

  Abstract                 = {The vast reduction in size and power consumption of CMOS circuitry has led to a large research effort based around the vision of ubiquitous networks of wireless communication nodes. As the networks, which are usually designed to run on batteries, increase in number and the devices decrease in size, the replacement of depleted batteries is not practical. Methods of scavenging ambient power for use by low power wireless electronic devices have been explored in an effort to make the wireless nodes and resulting wireless sensor networks indefinitely self-contained. After a broad survey of potential energy scavenging methods, the conversion of ambient vibrations to electricity was chosen as a method for further research. Converters based on both piezoelectric and electrostatic (capacitive) coupling were pursued. Both types of converters were carefully modeled. Designs were optimized based on the models developed within in total size constraint of 1 cm3. Test results from the piezoelectric converters demonstrate power densities of about 200 µW/cm3 from input vibrations of 2.25 m/s2 at 120 Hz. Furthermore, test results matched simulated outputs very closely thus verifying the validity of the model as a basis for design. One of the piezoelectric converters was used to completely power a small wireless sensor device from vibrations similar to those found in common environments. Electrostatic converters were designed for a category of MEMS processes in which a structural MEMS device is patterned in the top layer of a Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafer. Simulation results show a maximum power density of 110 µW/cm3 from the same vibration source. Initial electrostatic converter prototypes were fabricated in a SOI MEMS process. Prototypes have been tested and when manually actuated have demonstrated a net electrical power increase due to mechanical work done on the converter. However, a fully functional power generator driven by vibrations has yet to be demonstrated. Both theory and test results demonstrate that piezoelectric converters are capable of higher power output densities than electrostatic converters. However, because electrostatic converters are more easily implemented in silicon micromachining processes they hold the future potential for complete monolithic integration with silicon based sensors and microelectronics.},

A broad review of potential power scavenging technologies and conventional energy sources is first presented. Low-level vibrations occurring in common household and office environments as a potential power source are studied in depth. The goal of this paper is not to suggest that the conversion of vibrations is the best or most versatile method to scavenge ambient power, but to study its potential as a viable power source for applications where vibrations are present. Different conversion mechanisms are investigated and evaluated leading to specific optimized designs for both capacitive MicroElectroMechancial Systems (MEMS) and piezoelectric converters. Simulations show that the potential power density from piezoelectric conversion is significantly higher. Experiments using an off-the-shelf PZT piezoelectric bimorph verify the accuracy of the models for piezoelectric converters. A power density of 70 μW/cm3 has been demonstrated with the PZT bimorph. Simulations show that an optimized design would be capable of 250 μW/cm3 from a vibration source with an acceleration amplitude of 2.5 m/s2 at 120 Hz.},

Simulations of a radix-2, 256-symbol fast Fourier transform (FFT) show that the model produces equivalent results to those of a model that incorporates a mismatch term into each current mirror. It is shown that in general, high-radix FFT structures and specifically the full-radix DFT have reduced sensitivity to mismatch and a reduced number of current mirrors compared to radix-2 structures and have some key advantages in terms of transistor count with respect to comparable digital implementations. Simulations of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system with forward error control coding, that take into account current mirror nonidealities such as mismatch, show that an analog DFT front end loses only 0.5 dB with respect to an ideal circuit.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy-constrained wireless sensor networks have conflicting requirements between the need to communicate, and the desire to avoid idle listening and thus save energy. Beneath this simple observation lies a complex design space that encompasses all layers of the radio through application. Broad design principles include the desire to exploit resources external to the network, such as beacons and (perhaps mobile) access points that do not have strong energy constraints. We consider synchronization, scheduled communications rendezvous, and packet acquisition. Synchronization accuracy worsens with prediction interval, saves energy by enabling scheduling, but costs energy to maintain. Acquisition is probabilistic due to noise, fading, and synchronization error, with operating points defining energy-performance tradeoffs.},

A model of this evolution is presented, along with a comparison to experimental results. We also present an experimental method to measure the charge cloud radius in which the radial charge cloud distribution is assumed to be Gaussian. When a charge cloud is released from the MCP, its initial size is determined by the number and distribution of excited channels. The size of the charge cloud is examined as a function acceleration voltage, distance between MCP and anode, and MCP bias voltage. Since electrons released from the MCP have various initial energies and angular divergence, the charge cloud size increases as it travels away from the MCP. Space charge effects also contribute to the growth of the charge cloud. The experimental results are in close agreement with our model, which includes these effects. From experiment, we also derive an approximate expression for charge cloud radius as a function of acceleration voltage and distance between MCP and anode. This expression can be used for the practical design and optimization of a position sensing system comprised of multiple anodes.},

Design criteria and techniques of CMOS readout front ends are presented so as to fully exploit the maximal capability of a CMOS technology. The optimal input transistor dimensions and bias conditions of charge sensitive amplifiers (CSA) are analytically determined. For readout front ends using semi-Gaussian pulse shapers, the optimal number of integrators and the optimal peaking time are determined from the point of view of achieving the best detector resolution. In order to verify the theoretical analyses, a charge sensitive amplifier and a fourth-order semi-Gaussian pulse shaper with 1- mu;s peaking time have been designed in a standard 3- mu;m CMOS technology. Calculations and computer simulations show that by optimal design of input CSA and semi-Gaussian pulse shaper, a detector resolution as low as 600 equivalent noise electrons can be obtained for a 40-pF detector capacitance},

We obtain wide linear range by widening thetanh, or decreasing the ratio of transconductance to bias current,by a combination of four techniques. First, the well terminalsof the input differential-pair transistors are used as the amplifierinputs. Then, feedback techniques known as source degeneration(a common technique) and gate degeneration (a new technique)provide further improvements. Finally, a novel bump-linearizationtechnique extends the linear range even further. We present signal-flowdiagrams for speedy analysis of such circuit techniques. Ourtransconductance reduction is achieved in a compact 13-transistorcircuit without degrading other characteristics such as dc-inputoperating range. In a standard 2 µm process,we were able to obtain a linear range of ±1.7V.Using our wide-linear-range amplifier and a capacitor, we constructa follower–integrator with an experimental dynamic rangeof 65 dB. We show that, if the amplifier's noise is predominantlythermal, then an increase in its linear range increases thefollower–integrator'sdynamic range. If the amplifier's noise is predominantly 1/f,then an increase in its linear range has no effect on thefollower–integrator'sdynamic range. To preserve follower–integrator bandwidth,power consumption increases proportionately with an increasein the amplifier's linear range. We also present data for changesin the subthreshold exponential parameter with current leveland with gate-to-bulk voltage that should be of interest to alllow-power designers. We have described the use of our amplifierin a silicon cochlea [1, 2].},

Special attention will be paid to power management, inductive power links, bidirectional data links, recording of ENGs, and remote measurement of electrodes-tissues interfaces. A global view of typical micro-devices will be given and a case study related to intracortical microstimulation to create adequate vision for the blind will be presented.},

Since typical SMDs contain implantable parts, low power consumption and high reliability are among the main criteria that must be given priority when designing such wirelessly-powered microsystems. In order to calibrate the total inductively transmitted power to an implant, a wireless feedback loop is used. In addition, this inductive link allows full-duplex high data-rate communication, accomplished with a differential hard-limited Costas loop. A typical device, for monitoring and microstimulating the cortical tissues, comprises several integrated modules assembled on a thin substrate, providing placement flexibility in the body. Experimental results from integrated circuits are presented.},

The event-driven ADC is shut off in between detection events to further reduce power consumption. The circuit has been fabricated using a 0.18- #x003BC;m CMOS technology, with a power consumption ranging between 4 and 20 #x003BC;W, depending on the particle detection rate. This low-power operation facilitates the development of compact long-life battery-powered remote particle sensors.},

  Abstract                 = {Describes a 12 bit DAC which uses diffused resistors and requires no trimming to guarantee monotonicity for all grades over the temperature range. The segmented ladder design, departing from the traditional R-2R approach used in virtually all high-speed high resolution converters, provides inherent monotonicity and differential linearity as high as 13 bits. Also afforded is a more uniform step size over the temperature range than the trimmed 12 bit converters. The only critical resistor matching occurs at the major carries or midpoints of each of the eight segments and the tolerances are equivalent to that of a 9 bit DAC, or eight times lower than the R-2H approach. In essence, the problem has been divided into eight separate problems, each with tolerances eight times lower than that of a 12 bit DAC. The converter has been found to be immune to variations in temperature, time, process, and mechanical stress. The circuit also features differential high compliance current outputs, wide supply range, and a multiplying input.},

It is a circuit element that allows for digitally programming a precise bias current ranging over many decades, from pico-amperes up to hundreds of micro-amperes. <span class='snippet'>I</span>-<span class='snippet'>Pot</span> blocks can be chained within a chip to allow for any arbitrary number of programmable bias currents. The approach only requires to provide the chip with three external pins, the use of an external current measuring instrument, and a computer. This way, once all internal <span class='snippet'>I</span>-Pots have been characterized, they can be programmed through a computer to provide any desired current bias value with very low error. The circuit block turns out to be very practical for experimenting with new circuits (specially when a large number of biases are required), testing wide ranges of biases, introducing means for current mismatch calibration, offsets compensations, etc. using a reduced number of chip pins. We show experimental results of generating bias currents with errors of 0.38% (8 bits) for currents varying from 176 muA to 19.6 pA. Temperature effects are characterized.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a novel MCP imaging detector scheme using the Cross Strip (XS) anode. This anode uses charge division, and centroiding, of microchannel plate charge signals detected on two orthogonal layers of sense strips to encode event X-Y position, event time and signal amplitude. We have developed novel XS anode structures that will, in combination with a new generation of small pore MCP's ( lt; 4 mum pores), perform at the highest resolution levels ( lt;10 mum) with self triggered ~1 ns timing accuracy and encode photons at greater than 1 MHz rates. Our development the XS charge division scheme has been demonstrated with formats up to 32 mm2. They show excellent resolution (better than 7 mum FWHM, actually imaging the MCP pores) using low MCP gain (5 times 105). We have investigated XS anode structures that will accommodate a wide variety of forms (circular, square, rectangular). We are using this concept to produce open face and sealed tube detectors for imaging a wide range of photon and particle events. To encode event positions we have designed and built a parallel channel encoding electronics. The front end boards utilize two RD-20, 32 channel preamplifier ASICs. The pre- amplified signal is post-amplified on the same board in order to match the dynamic range of downstream 60 Msps ADCs that constantly digitize the signal for subsequent digital peak detection. Tests with eight 60 Msps ADC channels and a software Finite Impulse Response algorithm demonstrate lt; 5 mum electronic resolution and lt;10 mum resolution with a 32 mm XS anode detector. A full 64 channel 60 Msps ADC circuit has been constructed along with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA event processing board. In combination with firmware based Xilinx centroiding algorithms, encoding the event positions at more than 1 MHz rates over large areas should also be possible. Such detector system may be used for a variety of future missions, in solar, solar system and astronomical applicat- ions.},

Photon counting detectors that combine high spatial resolution imaging with fast event timing capability have been a significant technical challenge. We have developed a high-temporal and -spatial resolution, high-throughput sealed tube microchannel plate detector with electronic readout as a tool for HTRA applications. The design is based on a 25 mm diameter S20 photocathode followed by a microchannel plate stack, read out by a cross delay line anode with timing and imaging electronics. The detector supports 500 kHz global count rate, 10 kHz /100 Î¼m 2 /sec local count rate, and 100 ps timing resolution. We also describe high time resolution astronomical observations currently being obtained with the NASA GALEX UV satellite, as well as preliminary visible wavelength imaging results obtained on the Crab pulsar at the Lick Observatory.},

Unlike traditional wireless sensors that store energy in batteries, Everlast's use of supercapacitors enables the system to operate for an estimated lifetime of 20 years without any maintenance. The novelty of this system lies in the feed-forward, pulse frequency modulated converter and open-circuit solar voltage method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT), enabling the solar cell to efficiently charge the supercapacitor and power the node. Experimental results show that by its low-complexity MPPT, Everlast can achieve over 89% conversion efficiency with lower power overhead than the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude, while enabling charging a supercapacitor up to 400% faster than direct charging. This makes Everlast particularly applicable to miniature-scale, high-impedance energy harvesting systems.},

This is done through a three-fold approach that includes an assessment of currently available technology, a survey of State Department of Transportation practices, and a review of the literature. Traditional traffic counting has utilized intrusive devices including bending plate, pneumatic road tube, inductive loops, and piezo-electric sensors. As safety, cost, increased traffic flow, complex road geometrics, and traffic disruption have become issues of concern, traffic counting professionals are looking more closely at alternatives to traditional methods of data collection. Such non-traditional traffic counting devices as video image detection, Doppler microwave, passive magnetic, passive acoustic, active and passive infrared, and active and passive ultrasonic are being considered due to their non-intrusive nature. Information on available technology including cost, installation requirements, technical specifications, data retrieval, and limitations of the products are addressed. This information is followed by a summary of State practices that shows very limited usage of non-intrusive technology. Lastly, a review of the literature indicates there is little in the way of "new" technology. However, several evaluations of non-intrusive devices provide valuable information to traffic counting professionals that will assist in decision-making regarding upgrades to current practices.},

Further analysis reveals that the system electroacoustic reference efficiency is quantitatively related to system resonance frequency, the portion of total damping contributed by electromagnetic coupling, and total system compliance; for air-suspension systems, efficiency therefore effectively depends on frequency response and enclosure size. System acoustic power capacity is found to be fundamentally dependent on frequency response and the volume of air that can be displaced by the driver diaphragm; it may also be limited by enclosure size. Measurement of voice-coil impedance and other mechanical properties provides basic parameter data from which the important low-frequency performance capabilities of a system may be evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {We present WISP, a wireless, battery-free platform for sensing and computation that is powered and read by a standards compliant Ultra-High Fre- quency (UHF) RFID reader. To the reader, the WISP appears to be an ordinary RFID tag. The WISP platform includes a general-purpose programmable flash microcontroller and implements the bi-directional communication primitives re- quired by the Electronic Product Code (EPC) RFID standard, which allows it to communicate arbitrary sensor data via an EPC RFID reader by dynamically changing the ID it presents to the reader. For each 64 bit “packet,” the WISP’s microcontroller dynamically computes the 16-bit CRC that the EPC standard re- quires of valid packets. Because the WISP device can control all bits of the pre- sented ID, 64 bits of sensor data can be communicated with a single RFID read event. As an example of the system in operation, we present 13 hours of con- tinuous-valued light-level data measured by the device. All the measurements were made using power harvested from the RFID reader. No battery, and no wired connections (for either power or data) were used. As far as we are aware, this paper reports the first fully programmable computing platform that can oper- ate using power transmitted from a long-range (UHF) RFID reader and commu- nicate arbitrary, multi-bit data in response to a single RFID reader poll event.},

  Abstract                 = {Piezoelectric materials can be used as a means of transforming ambient vibrations into electrical energy that can then be stored and used to power other devices. With the recent surge of microscale devices, piezoelectric power generation can provide a convenient alternative to traditional power sources used to operate certain types of sensors/actuators, telemetry, and MEMS devices. However, the energy produced by these materials is in many cases far too small to directly power an electrical device. Therefore, much of the research into power harvesting has focused on methods of accumulating the energy until a sufficient amount is present, allowing the intended electronics to be powered. In a recent study by Sodano et al. (2004a) the ability to take the energy generated through the vibration of a piezoelectric material was shown to be capable of recharging a discharged nickel metal hydride battery. In the present study, three types of piezoelectric devices are investigated and experimentally tested to determine each of their abilities to transform ambient vibration into electrical energy and their capability to recharge a discharged battery. The three types of piezoelectric devices tested are the commonly used monolithic piezoceramic material lead–zirconate–titanate (PZT), the bimorph Quick Pack (QP) actuator, and the macro-fiber composite (MFC). The experimental results estimate the efficiency of the three devices tested and identify the feasibility of their use in practical applications. Different capacity batteries are recharged using each device, to determine the charge time and maximum capacity battery that can be charged. The results presented in this article provide a means of choosing the piezoelectric device to be used and estimate the amount of time required to recharge a specific capacity battery.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of capturing the normally lost energy surrounding a system and converting it into electrical energy that can be used to extend the lifetime of that system’s power supply or possibly provide an endless supply of energy to an electronic device has captivated many researchers and has brought forth a growing amount of attention to power harvesting. One of the most common methods of obtaining the energy surrounding a system is to use piezoelectric materials. Piezoelectric materials have a crystalline structure that provides a unique ability to convert an applied electrical potential into a mechanical strain or vice versa, or convert an applied strain into an electrical current. The latter of these two properties allows the material to function as a power harvesting medium. In most cases the piezoelectric material is strained through the ambient vibration around the structure, thus allowing a frequently unused energy source to be utilized for the purpose of powering small electronic systems. However, the amount of energy generated by these piezoelectric materials is far smaller than that needed by most electronic devices. For this reason, the methods of accumulating and storing the energy generated, until sufficient power has been captured, is the key to developing completely self-powered systems. This article quantifies the amount of energy generated by a piezoelectric plate and investigates two methods of accumulating the energy thus produced. The first method uses a capacitor, which in early research has been the most common method of storing the energy generated and the second utilizes rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries. The advantages of each method are discussed and the rechargeable battery is found to have more desirable qualities for power harvesting than the capacitor. Additionally, this manuscript represents, for the first time, the fact that the power output by a piezoelectric material is capable of recharging a discharged battery. Through the excitation of a piezoelectric plate, it is demonstrated that a 40 mAh battery can be charged in less than half an hour at resonance and in only a few hours with a random signal similar to that of a typical vibrating piece of machinery.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel autotransformer impedance transformation technique to improve the power efficiency of RF-to-DC power harvesting of passive transponders and wireless microsensors is proposed. The method utilizes a step-up autotransformer with a large turn ratio inserted between the antenna and the voltage multiplier to boost the signal prior to rectification while providing a matching impedance to the antenna. To have a large voltage gain while minimizing the silicon consumption of the step-up autotransformer, the number of turns of the spiral of the primary winding is kept low and the width of the spiral of the secondary winding is made smaller than that of the primary winding. This also effectively minimizes the effect of spiral-substrate parasitic capacitances of the transformers, eliminating the drawback of the widely used impedance transformation with resonating LC networks. Implemented in IBM-130 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology, simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed step-up autotransformer impedance transformation technique significantly improve the power efficiency.},

Thomas Seebeck, a German physicist, first noticed the thermoelectric effect in 1821 when he discovered that a voltage was developed in a loop containing two dissimilar metals, provided the two junctions were maintained at different temperature. Some devices have emerged over the years to exploit that property, but have in general been hampered by low efficiency of about 5% with corresponding value of (ZT) equal to approx one (and high cost) Despite the fact that thermoelectric devices are compact, quite, rugged, stable and very reliable; thermo electrics have found only in niche applications and their wide widespread acceptance depends upon discovery of new materials with high conversion efficiency. The issue of thermoelectric efficiency for automotive application is examined from the standpoint of what material figures of merit (FOMs) will enable solid-state devices to compete with conventional electricity generator or vapor compression refrigerators. It is estimated that FOMs of (ZT) equal to or greater than 8 will be required. Some of the emerging new bulk materials may eventually reach that level of performance. How ever layered thin &film structures based on two &dimensional quantum wells and short period super lattices appear to have qualities will enable rapid attainment of FOMs that signal economic competitiveness.},

  Abstract                 = { The purpose of this research is to identify single-point defects in rolling element bearings. These defects produce characteristic fault frequencies that appear in the machine vibration and tend to modulate the machine's frequencies of mechanical resonance. An amplitude modulation (AM) detector is developed to identify these interactions and detect the bearing fault while it is still in an incipient stage of development (i.e., to detect the instances of AM when the magnitude of the characteristic fault frequency itself is not significant). Use of this detector only requires machine vibration from one sensor and knowledge of the bearing characteristic fault frequencies. Computer simulations as well as machine vibration data from bearings containing outer race faults are used to confirm the proficiency of this proposed technique.},

  Abstract                 = {For various medical monitoring and sensing applications it is desirable to power the electronics by scavenging energy from any locally available source. An electrostatic motion-driven generator for low-frequency (human body) motion has been developed by the authors using microelectromechanical system technology. The prototype generates pulses of 250V on a 10-pF capacitor. This paper examines the design of a circuit and semiconductor devices to convert this energy to a low voltage. Because of the very small charge involved, the effects of leakage and parasitic stored charge are important. Converters for this application using silicon-on-insulator metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors and insulated gate bipolar transistors are compared using physics-based finite-element simulation. The overall effectiveness of the generation process is shown to be composed of several terms which are functions of system parameters such as generator flight time, semiconductor device area, and circuit inductance. It is shown that device area is a compromise between leakage current, charge storage, and on-state voltage. It can, for a given generator and inductance, be optimized to provide the maximum energy yield. Parasitic series inductance is shown to be of little importance to the circuit efficiency; however, parasitic capacitance has a significant influence.},

These detectors use charge division and centroiding of MCP charge signals directed onto two orthogonal layers of sensing anode strips to encode event position, event time, and signal amplitude. In this paper, we describe measurements designed to understand the maximum possible event rates that such detectors are capable of handling. For these measurements, the signals from each strip (32 on each axis for the anode discussed here) are sent to a preamplifier ASIC that outputs shaped unipolar pulses with 40 ns rise time and 200 ns fall time, which are then digitized at 62.5 mega-samples per second and written to disk. Offline analysis is performed on long data records (up to 25 milliseconds) containing many individual events at event rates up to 108 counts per second with different spatial distributions over the detector area. We present analysis algorithms and results on our measured ability to resolve events spatially and temporally as the event rate is increased. We also briefly discuss future plans to develop compact, fieldable systems based on this XS anode technology for a variety of applications, from astronomy to remote sensing.},

Since this device is compatible with standard CMOS fabrication processes, it can be easily integrated on-chip level and matches the needs for low-cost and small-size systems. As thermoelectric materials, both, pure poly-Si and poly-Si/sub 70%/Ge/sub 30%/ have been investigated. Emphasis was placed on a thermally optimized design and the reduction of the total electrical resistance of the generator. As a result of these improvements, a voltage of 5 V and an electrical power output of 1 uW for a matched consumer is achieved with generators of 1 cm2 in size at a temperature drop of about 5 K.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the design of a prototype IC called FPDR90 dedicated for readout of hybrid pixel semiconductor detectors used for X-ray imaging applications. The FPDR90 has dimensions of 4 mm #x00D7; 4 mm and was designed in CMOS 90 nm technology with 9 metal layers. The core of the IC is a matrix of 40 #x00D7; 32 pixels with 100 #x03BC;m #x00D7; 100 #x03BC;m pixel size. A 50 #x03BC;m diameter circular passivation opening in each pixel allows connecting FPDR90 to a semiconductor detector using bump bonding technique. Each pixel contains a charge sensitive amplifier (CSA), a main amplifier stage, two discriminators and two 16-bit ripple counters. To minimize the effective threshold spread at the discriminators inputs, one 7-bit and one 6-bit trim DACs are used in each pixel for threshold low and threshold high respectively. The data are read out via a single LVDS output with 200 Mbps rate. Each pixel contains about 1800 transistors and has a nominal power consumption of 42 #x03BC;W for nominal bias condition. The effective peaking time at the discriminator input is 28 ns and it is mainly determined by the time constants of the CSA. The gain is equal to 32 #x03BC;V/e- or 64 #x03BC;V/e- in the low and the high gain mode respectively. In the high gain mode the ENC without the detector is 91 e- rms and rises to 106 e- rms with stud bump-bonded pixel detector. The effective threshold spread at the discriminator input is only 0.76 mV (at one sigma level, with 7-bit trim DACs enabled), which corresponds to 12 e- rms at the input. The maximum count rate per pixel depends on the effective CSA feedback resistance. A dead time in the front-end can be set as low as 117 ns (paralyzable model). The FPDR90 can operate with two energy thresholds in the readout mode separate from exposure. Continuous readout is possible when only one threshold is used.},

Based on the proposed approach, the power consumption and the operation frequency of logic circuits can be scaled down linearly by changing the tail bias current of SCL gates over a very wide range spanning several orders of magnitude, which is not achievable in subthreshold CMOS circuits. Measurements in conventional 0.18 m CMOS technology show that the tail bias current of each gate can be set as low as 10 pA, with a supply voltage of 300 mV, resulting in a power-delay product of less than 1 fJ. Fundamental circuits such as ring oscillators and frequency dividers, as well as more complex digital blocks such as parallel multipliers designed by using the STSCL topology have been experimentally characterized.},

The wide tuning range in this filter has been achieved without using any switchable components or programmable building blocks, and the cutoff frequency of the filter can be adjusted simply through a controlling bias current. The filter has low-pass characteristics with fc = 20 Hz to 84 kHz while exhibiting a constant power consumption per cutoff frequency over its entire tuning range that is almost four decades wide. The proposed MOSFET-C filter uses PMOS transistors in subthreshold regime for implementing floating and widely adjustable resistors. The ultra high resistivity of the PMOS devices makes them very suitable for implementing very low frequency and compact filters. Realized in 0.18 mum CMOS technology, the filter exhibits a relatively constant noise and linearity performance over its entire tuning range. The active area of the proposed MOSFET-C filter is 0.09 mm2.},

The method is aimed at reducing the cost of test (CoT) for systems-on-chip (SoC) devices while taking advantage of digital resources already present in the SoC devices, and using low-cost digital testers, respectively. It is based on Walsh functions, the Fast Walsh Transformation (FWT) and a simple digital processing algorithm. Since both test signal generation and test response analysis are performed on-chip, it leads to an efficient and robust approach very suitable to built-in self-test (BIST) applications, too. Considerations for on-chip implementation are also addressed together with simulation and experimental results that validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {An investigation of the equivalent circuits of loudspeakers in vented boxes shows that it is possible to make the low-frequency acoustic response equivalent to an ideal high-pass filter or as close an approximation as is desired. The simplifying assumptions appear justified in practice and the techniques involved are simple. The low-frequency performance of a loudspeaker can be adequately defined by three parameters, the resonant frequency f, a volume of air V, equivalent to its acoustic compliance, and the ratio of electrical resistance to motional reactance at the resonant frequency Q. From these three parameters, the electroacoustic efficiency (symbol) can be found also. A plea is made to loudspeaker manufacturers to publish these parameters as basic information on their product. The influence of other speaker constants on these parameters is investigated. When f and V are know, a loudspeaker box can be designed to give a variety of predictable responses which are different kinds of high-pass 24-dB per octave filters. For each response, a certain value of Q is required which depends not only on the Q of the loudspeaker but also the damping factor of the amplifier, for which a negative value is often required. The usual tuning arrangement leads to a response which can be that of a fourth-order Butterworth filter. This, however, is only a special case, and a whole family of responses may be obtained by varying the volume and tuning of the box. Also an empirical -law- may be overcome by the use of filtering in the associated amplifier. For example, for a given frequency response, the box volume can be reduced at the price of increased low-frequency output from the amplifier and vice versa, with little change in the motion required of the loudspeaker. Acoustic damping of the vent is shown to be unnecessary. Examples are given of typical parameters and enclosure designs.},

Not only are the battery and power components difficult to integrate but their performance requirements in mobile environments are more stringent. And although point-of-load (PoL) regulation techniques and monolithic controllers are industry standards today, more integration is indispensable. To address these issues, system-in-package (SiP) self-renewable energy source and storage devices are proposed alongside an array of circuit techniques designed to circumvent the shortcomings of such a miniaturized environment, like smart load-sharing schemes, customizable and self-adaptive PoL regulators, active inductor and capacitor multipliers, and robust self-calibrating and self-stabilizing dc-dc converters. On their own, each seeks to push the limits of integration while maintaining and many times improving performance. As a whole, they promise the birth of a new generation of ICs.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern portable micro-systems like biomedical implants and ad-hoc wireless transceiver micro-sensors continue to integrate more functions into smaller devices, which result in low energy levels and short operational lives. Researchers and industry alike are consequently considering harvesting energy from the surrounding environment as a means of offsetting this energy deficit. Even with power efficient designs, low duty-cycle operation, smart power-aware network architectures, and batteries with improved energy density, the stored energy in micro-scale systems is simply not sufficient to sustain extended lifetimes. Fortunately, the surrounding environment is a rich source of energy, from solar and thermal to kinetic, but harnessing it without dissipating much power in the process is challenging. In this paper, an electrostatic vibrational energy harvester circuit is proposed and evaluated. It harnesses energy from inherent vibrations in the system (e.g., engine-powered applications) by modulating the parallel-plate distance of a variable capacitor and channeling the resulting change in charge into a secondary Li-ion micro-battery. The varactor, in essence, behaves like a vibration-dependent current source. Simulations show that a 100-to-1 pF variable plate capacitor subjected to vibrations with a period of 15 mus produces an average harvesting current of 40.8 muA, an energy gain of 569 pj per cycle, and a net average power gain of 38 muW.},

Significant improvements in spatial resolution, quantum efficiency, and background rate have made these devices attractive for many applications and are being applied to completely new research areas. We describe the latest developments in high-resolution cross-strip (XS) anode readout for photon counting imaging with microchannel plates (MCPs). We show that the spatial resolution of an MCP detector with the cross-strip readout is now limited only by the MCP pore width. For the first time, we show images of resolution test masks illustrating the exceptional spatial resolution of the cross-strip readout, which at the present time can resolve features on the scale of sim;7 mu;m with MCP gains as low as 6 times;105. Low-gain operation of the detector with high spatial resolution shown in this paper is very beneficial for applications with high local counting rate and long lifetime requirements. The spatial resolution of the XS anode can be increased even further with improved anode uniformity, lower noise front-end electronics, and new centroiding algorithms. This could be important when MCPs with smaller than existing 6 mu;m pores become commercially available, thus improving the detector resolution down to the few micrometer scale.},

Recent advances in analog to digital converters and FPGA devices enable fully parallel high speed multichannel data processing with digital peak detection enhanced by finite impulse response filtering. Not only can accurate charge values be obtained at high event rates, but the timing of the event on each channel can also be determined with high accuracy. We present the concept and first experimental tests of fully parallel 128-channel charge sensitive data processing electronics capable of measuring charges with an accuracy of ~1000 e- rms. Our system does not require an external trigger and, in addition to charge values, it provides the event timing with an accuracy of ~1 ns FWHM. One of the possible applications of this system is high resolution position sensitive event counting detectors with microchannel plates combined with cross strip readout. Implementation of fast data acquisition electronics increases the counting rates of those detectors to multi-MHz level, preserving their unique capability of virtually noiseless detection of both position (with an accuracy of ~10 mum FWHM) and timing (~1 ns FWHM) of individual particles, including photons, electrons, ions, neutrals, and neutrons.},

To investigate the charge footprint variation, we introduce a ballistic model of the charge cloud propagation based on the energy and angular distribution at the MCP output. We also simulate the Coulomb repulsion in the electron cloud, which is likely to cause the experimentally observed increase in the cloud size with increasing MCP gain. Calculation results for both models are compared to the charge footprint sizes measured both in our experiments with high rear-field values ( #x223c;200 #x2013;900 V/mm) and in the experiments of Edgar etal [Rev.

  Abstract                 = {Thin film piezoelectric materials offer a number of advantages in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), due to the large motions that can be generated, often with low hysteresis, the high available energy densities, as well as high sensitivity sensors with wide dynamic ranges, and low power requirements. This paper reviews the literature in this field, with an emphasis on the factors that impact the magnitude of the available piezoelectric response. For non-ferroelectric piezoelectrics such as ZnO and AlN, the importance of film orientation is discussed. The high available electrical resistivity in AlN, its compatibility with CMOS processing, and its high frequency constant make it especially attractive in resonator applications. The higher piezoelectric response available in ferroelectric films enables lower voltage operation of actuators, as well as high sensitivity sensors. Among ferroelectric films, the majority of the MEMS sensors and actuators developed have utilized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films as the transducer. Randomly oriented PZT films show piezoelectric e31,f coefficients of about -7 C/m2 at the morphotropic phase boundary. In PZT films, orientation, composition, grain size, defect chemistry, and mechanical boundary conditions all impact the observed piezoelectric coefficients. The highest achievable piezoelectric responses can be observed in {001} oriented rhombohedrally-distorted perovskites. For a variety of such films, e31,f coefficients of -12 to -27 C/m2 have been reported.},

Let K denote the total number <span class='snippet'>of</span> frequencies in the <span class='snippet'>signal</span>, and let W denote its band limit in hertz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the <span class='snippet'>signal</span>. This <span class='snippet'>sampling</span> rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate <span class='snippet'>of</span> W hertz. In contrast to Nyquist <span class='snippet'>sampling</span>, one must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the <span class='snippet'>signal</span> from the samples taken by the random demodulator.

The conventional resonance method with a constant voltage circuit exhibits significant distortion (or a hysteresis) in the resonance frequency spectrum under a high vibration level due to large elastic non-linearity, which limits precise determination of the electromechanical coupling parameters. To the contrary, the resonance method with a constant current circuit (i.e., constant velocity) can determine the coupling parameters more precisely from a perfectly-symmetrical resonance spectrum. The general problem in both resonance methods is heat generation in the sample during the measurement. In order to separate the temperature characteristic from the non-linearity, it is recommended that the pulse method be used in parallel, even though the accuracy is not very high.},

  Abstract                 = {A pseudodifferential CMOS operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with wide tuning range and large input voltage swing has been designed for very small GM's (of the order of a few nanoamperes per volt). The OTA is based on a modified four-quadrant multiplier architecture with current division. A common-mode feedback circuit structure has been proposed and designed using floating-gate transistors to handle large differential signals. Large on-chip capacitors are emulated through impedance scaling circuits. The circuits, fabricated in a 1.2-μm CMOS process, have been used to design a fourth-order bandpass filter and a relaxation oscillator. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results},

  Abstract                 = {A prototype real-time, smart sensor array for measuring soil moisture and soil temperature that uses off-the-shelf components was developed and evaluated for scheduling irrigation in cotton. The array consists of a centrally located receiver connected to a laptop computer and multiple sensor nodes installed in the field. The sensor nodes consist of sensors (up to three Watermark^(R) soil moisture sensors and up to four thermocouples), a specially designed circuit board, and a Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag which transmits data to the receiver. The smart sensor array described here offers real potential for reliably monitoring spatially variable soil water status in crop fields. The relatively low cost of the system (~USD 2400 for a 20-sensor node system) allows for installation of a dense population of soil moisture sensors that can adequately represent the inherent soil variability present in fields. This paper describes the smart sensor array and testing in a cotton crop. Integration of the sensors with precision irrigation technologies will provide a closed loop irrigation system where inputs from the smart sensor array will determine timing and amounts for real-time site-specific irrigation applications.},

Technology improvements and design cleverness have been devoted mostly to reaching higher speed and higher precision. In recent years, there has been a sudden change driven mainly by an urgent need for portability, but also by concerns about the growing relative cost of power supplies and of heat removal systems, and even about limits of power available from the local network. It has now become necessary to build new products with at least the same performance in speed and dynamic range, but with stringent requirements on low power. This raises questions about the limits and how they can be approached},

  Abstract                 = {A general theory that allows the accurate linear and nonlinear analysis of any crystal oscillator circuit is presented. It is based on the high Q of the resonator and on a very few nonlimiting assumptions. The special case of the three-point oscillator, that includes Peirce and one-pin circuits, is analyzed in more detail. A clear insight into the linear behavior, including the effect of losses, is obtained by means of the circular locus of the circuit impedance. A basic condition for oscillation and simple analytic expressions are derived in the lossless case for frequency pulling, critical transconductance, and start-up time constant. The effects of nonlinearities on amplitude and on frequency stability are analyzed. As an application, a 2-MHz CMOS oscillator which uses amplitude stabilization to minimize power consumption and to eliminate the effects of nonlinearities on frequency is described. The chip, implemented in a 3- mu m p-well low-voltage process, includes a three-stage frequency divider and consumes 0.9 mu A at 1.5 V. The measured frequency stability is 0.05 p.p.m./V in the range 1.1-5 V of supply voltage. Temperature effect on the circuit itself is less than 0.1 p.p.m. from -10 to +60 degrees C.<>},

Various circuit configurations taking advantage of weak inversion operation are described and analyzed: two different current references based on known bipolar circuits, an amplitude detector scheme which is then applied to a quartz oscillator with the result of a very low-power consumption (&lt;0.1 &mu;W at 32 kHz), and a low-frequency bandpass amplifier.

The charge amplifiers attached to each cathode strip introduce noise which is added to the signal. This noise broadens the position resolution line. Our article gives an analytical tool to estimate the resolution broadening due to the noise per strip and the number of strips involved in the centroid calculation. It is shown that the position resolution increases faster than the square root of the number of strips involved. We also consider the consequence of added interstrip capacitors, intended to diminish the differential nonlinearity. It is shown that the position error increases slower than linearly with the interstrip capacities, due to the cancellation of correlated noise. The estimation we give, can be applied to calculations of position broadening other than the centroid finding.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy-aware design is highly desirable for systems that encounter a wide diversity of operating scenarios. This is in contrast to traditional low power design for the worst case scenario, which may not be globally energy efficient. Energy-aware design focuses on enabling architectures which scale down-energy as quality requirements are relaxed. A new energy-scalable system design methodology is proposed for a Real-Valued FFT processor which supports variable bit precision (8 and 16-bit precision) and variable FFT length (128-512 point). Two energy-aware architectures, Ensemble of Point Solutions method and Reuse of Point Solutions method, are described and evaluated. Simulated and measured results show a 66% energy savings for 8-bit datapath and 52% savings for 128-point FFT length over a non-scalable approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A traditional method to gather water consumption data from water meters in residential areas by using human recorders is costly and time consuming. Many AMR (Automatic Meter Reading) methods have been proposed to assist data gathering. A wireless ad-hoc sensor network configuration could be an alternative to reduce the cost of AMR. Some existing sensor network protocols such as LEACH, PEGASIS, and PEDAP could be applied. However, these protocols may not be perfectly suitable for water meters because data fusion is not possible in this particular application. In this paper, we propose a power efficient data gathering algorithm for wireless water meter networks. This algorithm uses a new approach to generate trees in order to distribute loads of root nodes to achieve a longer network lifetime. Simulation results show that our algorithm could yield better performances than a classical minimum spanning tree algorithm used in some existing algorithms such as PEDAP.},

  Abstract                 = {This dissertation presents the analog harmonic transform (AHT) and a first implementation in an integrated circuit. The transform is designed for a regular and simple hardware structure. It provides coefficients relating to an input signal's spectrum. These coefficients also have a simple relationship to the signal's Fouri\'er series coefficients.
The AHT is defined in its ideal form and evaluated for two example signal classification applications. Both military vehicle and bearing fault classification tasks are presented which validate the ability of a neural network to use the AHT coefficients to correctly classify the input signals. Because any real use of the AHT for classification would include various errors, a study determining the required hardware specifications is described.
These specifications are used to inform the design of a hardware implementation of the AHT coefficient generation. A prototype system in a 0.13um mixed-signal CMOS process was designed to confirm the new system's utility. The prototype chip included two separate blocks of AHT circuitry along with an on-board custom microprocessor to implement system control and supervision in a 4x4mm die area.
A new digitally-controlled operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) was designed as the core circuit element to support the AHT calculations. The OTA's offset and gain can be calibrated after fabrication to yield lower errors without significant increases in chip area or power consumption. This enables hardware implementation of applications, such as the AHT, which have strict offset requirements to maintain good system-level performance.
Testing of fabricated prototype chips confirms the ability of digital offset tuning to yield amplifiers having sub-10mV output-referred offset with both low power and small die area. An algorithm was created to adaptively find the optimum tuning code, needed because the tuning characteristic is not guaranteed monotonic. Testing also confirms the reliable operation of OTAs with extremely large (giga-ohm) output impedances. Low-frequency operation with long time constants requires these impedance levels to minimize integration capacitor size, the dominant factor in determining die area.

  Abstract                 = {A low-power analog sensor front-end is described that reduces the energy required to extract environmental sensing spectral features without using Fast Fouri´er Transform (FFT) or wavelet transforms. An Analog Harmonic Transform (AHT) allows selection of only the features needed by the back-end, in contrast to the FFT, where all coefficients must be calculated simultaneously. We also show that the FFT coefficients can be easily calculated from the AHT results by a simple back-substitution. The scheme is tailored for low-power, parallel analog implementation in an integrated circuit (IC). Two different applications are tested with an ideal front-end model and compared to existing studies with the same data sets. Results from the military vehicle classification and identification of machine-bearing fault applications shows that the front-end suits a wide range of harmonic signal sources. Analog-related errors are modeled to evaluate the feasibility of and to set design parameters for an IC implementation to maintain good system-level performance. Design of a preliminary transistor-level integrator circuit in a 0.13µm complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) integrated circuit process showed the ability to use online self-calibration to reduce fabrication errors to a sufficiently low level. Estimated power dissipation is about three orders of magnitude less than similar vehicle classification systems that use commercially available FFT spectral extraction.},

  Abstract                 = {Historically, buck converters have relied on high-Q inductors on the order of 1 to 100 muH to achieve a high efficiency. Unfortunately, on-chip inductors are physically large and have poor series resistances, which result in low-efficiency converters. To mitigate this problem, on-chip magnetic coupling is exploited in the proposed stacked interleaved topology to enable the use of small (2 nH) on-chip inductors in a high-efficiency buck converter. The dramatic decrease in the inductance value is made possible by the unique bridge timing of the stacked design that causes magnetic coupling to boost the converter's efficiency by reducing the current ripple in each inductor. The magnetic coupling is realized by stacking the two inductors on top of one another, which not only lowers the required inductance, but also reduces the chip area consumed by the two inductors. The measured conversion efficiency for the prototype circuit, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS technology, shows more than a 15% efficiency improvement over a linear converter for low output voltages rising to a peak efficiency of 77.9 % for a 0.9 V output. These efficiencies are comparable to converters implemented with higher Q inductors, validating that the proposed techniques enable high-efficiency converters to be realized with small on-chip inductors.},

The method is adequate for low-power unattended sensors which perform sensing, feature extraction, and classification in a standalone scenario. Harmonics' amplitudes approximating the harmonic signature of the time domain acoustic signal captured by wireless sensor nodes are estimated for vehicle discrimination. The computational complexity for the time domain features extracted from ground vehicles' acoustic signals is lower than their equivalent spectral features. Classification is performed using a multilayer feedforward neural network, where discrimination between vehicles depends on their acoustic signature irrespective of their speed or location. Evaluation of the time domain method, through processing of an acoustic data set for heavyweight and lightweight military ground vehicles with comparison to spectral features, shows that time domain harmonics' amplitudes are simpler to obtain and provide the reliability of the spectral features in both the detection and false alarm rate.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, zero-crossing characteristic features are employed for early detection and identification of single point bearing defects in rotating machinery. As a result of bearing defects, characteristic defect frequencies appear in the machine vibration signal, normally requiring spectral analysis or envelope analysis to identify the defect type. Zero-crossing features are extracted directly from the time domain vibration signal using only the duration between successive zero-crossing intervals and do not require estimation of the rotational frequency. The features are a time domain representation of the composite vibration signature in the spectral domain. Features are normalized by the length of the observation window and classification is performed using a multilayer feedforward neural network. The model was evaluated on vibration data recorded using an accelerometer mounted on an induction motor housing subjected to a number of single point defects with different severity levels.},

  Abstract                 = {An application is proposed for detection and classification of battlefield ground vehicles using the emitted acoustic signal captured at individual sensor nodes of an ad hoc Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). We make use of the harmonic characteristics of the acoustic emissions of battlefield vehicles, in reducing both the computations carried on the sensor node and the transmitted data to the fusion center for reliable and effcient classification of targets. Previous approaches focus on the lower frequency band of the acoustic emissions up to 500Hz; however, we show in the proposed application how effcient discrimination between battlefield vehicles is performed using features extracted from higher frequency bands (50 - 1500Hz). The application shows that selective time domain acoustic features surpass equivalent spectral features. Collaborative signal processing is utilized, such that estimation of certain signal model parameters is carried by the sensor node, in order to reduce the communication between the sensor node and the fusion center, while the remaining model parameters are estimated at the fusion center. The transmitted data from the sensor node to the fusion center ranges from 1 ~ 5% of the sampled acoustic signal at the node. A variety of classification schemes were examined, such as maximum likelihood, vector quantization and artificial neural networks. Evaluation of the proposed application, through processing of an acoustic data set with comparison to previous results, shows that the improvement is not only in the number of computations but also in the detection and false alarm rate as well.},

Our experimental results show that: 1) for each classifier the performance in the adaptive mode that uses simple majority voting is much better than in the non-adaptive mode; 2) all FLRBCs perform substantially better than the Bayesian classifier; 3) interval type-2 (T2) FLRBCs perform better than their competing type-1 (T1) FLRBCs, although sometimes not by much; 4) the interval T2 nonhierarchical and HFLRBC-series architectures perform the best; and 5) all FLRBCs achieve higher than the acceptable 80% classification accuracy},

It is implemented using a 1-bit comparator/latch pair per pixel or per group of neighboring pixels, and a digital-to-analog-converter/controller shared by all pixels. The comparator/latch pair operates at very slow speeds and can be implemented using simple robust circuits. The ADCs can be fully tested by applying electrical signals without any optics or light sources. A CMOS 320 times;256 sensor using the MCBS ADC is described. The chip measures 4.14 times;5.16 mm2. It achieves 10 times;10 mu;m2 pixel size at 28% fill factor in 0.35 mu;m CMOS technology. Each 2 times;2 pixel block shares an ADC. The pixel block circuit comprises 18 transistors. It operates in subthreshold to maximize gain and minimize power consumption. The power consumed by the sensor array is 20 mW at 30 frames/s. The measured integral nonlinearity is 2.3 LSB, and differential nonlinearity is 1.2 LSB at eight bits of resolution. The standard deviation of the gain and offset fixed pattern noise due to the ADC are 0.24 and 0.2%, respectively},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis results demonstrate that multiple sampling can achieve consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio at equal or higher dynamic range than using other image sensor dynamic range enhancement schemes such as well capacity adjusting. Implementing multiple sampling, however, requires much higher readout speeds than can be achieved using typical CMOS active pixel sensor (APS). This paper demonstrates, using a 640 times;512 CMOS image sensor with 8-b bit-serial Nyquist rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) per 4 pixels, that pixel-level ADC enables a highly flexible and efficient implementation of multiple sampling to enhance dynamic range. Since pixel values are available to the ADC's at all times, the number and timing of the samples as well as the number of bits obtained from each sample can be freely selected and read out at fast SRAM speeds. By sampling at exponentially increasing exposure times, pixel values with binary floating-point resolution can be obtained. The 640 times;512 sensor is implemented in 0.35- mu;m CMOS technology and achieves 10.5 times;10.5 mu;m pixel size at 29% fill factor. Characterization techniques and measured quantum efficiency, sensitivity, ADC transfer curve, and fixed pattern noise are presented. A scene with measured dynamic range exceeding 10000:1 is sampled nine times to obtain an image with dynamic range of 65536:1. Limits on achievable dynamic range using multiple sampling are presented},

A new dual-channel low side resonant gate drive circuit is proposed in this paper. The proposed drive circuit can provide two symmetrical drive signals for driving two MOSFETs. It charges and discharges the MOSFET gate capacitor with a constant current source. Both gate drive loss and, more importantly, switching loss can be reduced significantly. The proposed resonant gate drive circuit can be used to drive the synchronous MOSFETs in a current doubler or full-wave rectifier configuration.

Extensive simulations have been performed demonstrating that the link can operate at a speed of 1 Gbps for all the technology corners, exhibiting a power consumption of 27.8 mW for the transmitter and 12.3 mW for the receiver. In the simulation the transmission channel was modelled as a 50 cm cat5E UTP cable, connected to the AER chip through 5 cm PCB traces modelled as a coupled microstrip transmission line. The design has been completed up to the layout level and has been submitted for fabrication. The transmitter and the receiver take up an area of 311times148 mum2 and 300x148 mum2 respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a serializer/deserializer scheme for asynchronous address event representation (AER) bit-serial interchip communications. Each serial AER (sAER) link uses four wires: a micro strip pair for low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) and two handshaking lines. Each event is represented by a 32-bit word. Two extra preamble bits are used for alignment. Transmission clock is embedded in the data using Manchester encoding. As opposed to conventional LVDS links, the presented approach allows to stop physical communication between data events, so that no #x201C;comma #x201D; characters need to be transmitted during these pauses. As soon as a new event needs to be transmitted, the link recovers immediately thanks to a built-in control voltage memorization circuit. As a result, power consumption of the serializer and deserializer circuits is proportional to data event rate. The approach is also highly tolerant to clock jitter, due to the asynchronous nature and the Manchester encoding. A chip test prototype has been fabricated in standard 0.35 #x03BC;m CMOS including a pair of Serializer and Deserializer circuits. Maximum measured event transmission rate is 15 Meps (mega events per second) for 32-bit events, with a maximum bit transmission speed of 670 Mbps (mega bits per second).},

  Abstract                 = {For electric power transmission, high voltage overhead power lines play an important role as the costs for power transmission are comparatively low. However, the environmental conditions in many geographical regions can change over a wide range. Due to the high voltages, adequate distances between the conductors and objects in the environment have to be ensured for safety reasons. However, sag of the conductors (e.g. due to temperature variations or aging, icing of conductors as a result of extreme weather conditions) may increase safety margins and limit the operability of these power lines. Heavy loads due to icing or vibrations excited by winds increase the risk of line breakage. With online condition monitoring of power lines, critical states or states with increased wear for the conductor may be detected early and appropriate counter measures can be applied. In this paper we investigate possibilities for monitoring devices that are directly mounted onto a conductor. It is demonstrated that such a device can be powered from the electric field around the conductor and that electronic equipment can be protected from the strong electric and magnetic fields as well as transient signals due to partial discharge events.},
